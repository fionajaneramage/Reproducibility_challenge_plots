This repository contains data and analysis scripts for the CAMARADES reproducibility challenge. 

- The `Data` folder contains both `Provided` (i.e., raw) and `Entered` (i.e., derived) data from each of the 5 participating teams.
- There are separate analysis scripts for plotting screening, risk of bias analysis, and meta-analysis results.
- The `Plots` folder contains plots generated by the analysis scripts.
