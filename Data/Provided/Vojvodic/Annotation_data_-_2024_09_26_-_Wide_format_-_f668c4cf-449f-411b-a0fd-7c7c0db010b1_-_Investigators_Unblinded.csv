86eac6a5-8cb0-4620-8391-4fe0c72a219e,Blood as the carrier of ischemic tolerance in rat brain,P. Bonova;M. Gottlieb,Journal of Neuroscience Research,Journal of Neuroscience Research,"This study provides clear evidence that the factor inducing tolerance to ischemia is transmitted via the circulating blood. By using the remote ischemia and the cross-circulation model, the tolerance to ischemia was transmitted from donor to recipient. For this study, the following experimental groups were designed: I, sham control group; II, group of tolerant hindlimb tourniquet-treated rats; III, positive control group; IV, control for cross-circulation influence; preconditioned animals: V, tolerant animals subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO); VI, tolerant animals cross-circulated with SHC, followed by MCAO; VII, SHC animals cross-circulated with tolerant animals and subsequently subjected to MCAO; VIII, tolerant animals cross-circulated with ischemic rats, followed by MCAO; IX, SHC animals cross-circulated with ischemic animals and subjected to MCAO; postconditioned animals: X, ischemic animals treated with a remote limb tourniquet; XI, ischemic animals cross-circulated with SHC control rats; and XII, ischemic animals cross-circulated with tolerant rats. Results confirmed that remote ischemia induced reduction of infarct volume in the preconditioned (V, 60%) as well as in the postconditioned group (X, 52%). Significant diminution was also observed in group XII (56.6%). In the preconditioned group, decreased infarct volume was detected in groups VI and VII (about 65%) and in group IX (about 50%). The greatest infarct reduction (84%) was induced by the presence of ischemic blood in a tolerant rat before ischemia induction. In summary, the factor inducing tolerance to ischemia is generated by remote ischemia and by ischemia itself; from the site of origin to the rest of the body, it is transported by the systemic blood circulation and can be transferred from animal to animal. The effect of conditioning with two different ischemic events (brain and hindlimb ischemia) led to a cumulative, stronger tolerance response.

Gottlieb,European Journal of Neuroscience,European Journal of Neuroscience,"Ischemic tolerance (IT) has gained attention as an attractive strategy for improving stroke outcome. Recently, it was shown that signal responsible for rapid IT induction (tolerance induction factor - TIF) is transmitted via circulating blood. In this study, we have hypothesized about the role of the blood cell compartment in TIF production. We used hind-limb ischemia to generate TIF as a rapid preconditioning against transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The essential properties of protein synthesis inhibitors actinomycin D and cycloheximide were utilized to obtain the following results: (i) TIF is proteinaceous. Hind-limb ischemia mediates gene expression followed by translation, resulting in the production of TIF. Blocking of each of these two steps in protein synthesis resulted in rapid infarct evolution (281.5 +/- 23.37 and 330.4 +/- 71.8 mm(3), respectively). (ii) Tourniquet-treated muscle is not a source of TIF. Actinomicine D injected into rat prior to tolerance induction significantly suppressed RNA synthesis in blood cells and muscle tissue.

Paul,Sleep,Sleep,"Study Objectives: Episodes of brief limb ischemia (remote preconditioning) in mice induce tolerance to modeled ischemic stroke (focal brain ischemia). Since stroke outcomes are in part dependent on sleep-wake history, we sought to determine if sleep is critical for the neuroprotective effect of limb ischemia.Methods: EEG/EMG recording electrodes were implanted in mice. After a 24 h baseline recording, limb ischemia was induced by tightening an elastic band around the left quadriceps for 10 minutes followed by 10 minutes of release for two cycles. Two days following remote preconditioning, a second 24 h EEG/EMG recording was completed and was immediately followed by a 60-minute suture occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (modeled ischemic stroke). This experiment was then repeated in a model of circadian and sleep abnormalities (Bmal1 knockout [KO] mice sleep 2 h more than wild-type littermates). Brain infarction was determined by vital dye staining, and sleep was assessed by trained identification of EEG/EMG recordings.Results: Two days after limb ischemia, wild-type mice slept an additional 2.4 h. This additional sleep was primarily comprised of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep during the middle of the light-phase (i.e., naps). Repeating the experiment but preventing increases in sleep after limb ischemia abolished tolerance to ischemic stroke.

In Bmal1 knockout mice, remote preconditioning did not increase daily sleep nor provide tolerance to subsequent focal ischemia.Conclusions: These results suggest that sleep induced by remote preconditioning is both sufficient and necessary for its neuroprotective effects on stroke outcome.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000388930800014,"Morehouse Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Circadian Rhythms & Sleep Disorders Program, Atlanta, GA 30310 USAMorehouse Sch Med, Inst Neurosci, Translat Programs Stroke, Atlanta, GA 30310 USAWalter Reed Army Inst Res, Ctr Mil Psychiat & Neurosci, Behav Biol Branch, Silver Spring, MD USAUniv Calif Los Angeles, Dept Integrat Biol & Physiol, Los Angeles, CA USA",2016,"PII sp-00070-1610.5665/sleep.6238",Journal Article,mouse;ischemia;homeostatic;circadian;neuroprotection;tolerance;stroke;ischemia;brain,/1701500465/Brager-2016-Sleep Is Critical for Remote Preco.pdf,,2024-08-16 14:07:02,825ebfc6-7a60-4df4-86a2-98f0c26f4ecb,SR-SAVI_RIC,False,1b96b68f-9627-4436-b421-db699510f2ae,sofija vojvodic,d1f9aadc-269f-4b7a-ba89-8772b32dec7a,unclear,,2024-09-19 14:35:35,3419ad09-5f44-414f-8319-97635aa8aeda,unclear,,2024-09-19 14:35:35,9faa5016-e413-4587-9a61-907e09f7b496,unclear,,2024-09-19 14:35:35,71227a17-65b1-41b3-a219-26c41882570e,unclear,,2024-09-19 14:35:35,3180529c-b6fd-4cd3-ae11-fee8deeb098c,unclear,,2024-09-19 14:35:35,5f7ea409-aa09-4fdf-b976-a73ea467dafd,low,,2024-09-19 14:35:35,60802a95-588d-4373-9213-c17bec02ff35,low,,2024-09-19 14:35:35

We have recently demonstrated that remote ischemic conditioning by transient hind limb ischemia delivered during ischemia and before reperfusion can provide potent cardioprotection, a phenomenon we termed per-conditioning. This study evaluated whether remote ischemic per-conditioning may provide neuroprotection in a clinically relevant rat model of acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: Remote ischemic conditioning by transient limb ischemia was used in a rat transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model of acute stroke. A total of 39 P60 rats were randomly allocated to receive preconditioning, per-conditioning, or sham conditioning. Cerebral ischemia was maintained for 120 minutes followed by reperfusion. The resulting infarct size at 24 hours was quantified using computerized image analysis of 2-3-5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride-stained brain sections. RESULTS: Compared with control, both pre- and per-conditioning significantly reduced brain infarct size with the more clinically relevant per-conditioning stimulus being superior to preconditioning.

L. Zhao;Y. Y. Ran;Y. Meng;X. M. Ji;X. K. Geng;H. S. Du;X. M. Hu,Journal of Neuroinflammation,Journal of Neuroinflammation,"Background: Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) of a limb has been reported to protect against ischemic stroke. Our previous results demonstrated that the RIPC-mediated neuroprotection is associated with alterations in circulating immune cell populations. Here, we evaluated the effect of the spleen, the largest reservoir of immune cells, on RIPC-mediated neuroprotection against stroke.Methods: Noninvasive RIPC was achieved by four repeated cycles of 5-min blood flow constriction in the hindlimbs using a tourniquet. The blood and spleens were collected before and 1 h and 3 days after preconditioning to analyze the effect of RIPC on the spleen and the correlation between splenic and peripheral lymphocytes. Moreover, spleen weight and splenic lymphocytes were compared in stroke rats with or without RIPC. Finally, splenectomy was made 1 day or 2 weeks before RIPC and 90-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The infarct areas and deficits were assessed. Blood was collected 1 h after RIPC and 3 days after MCAO to explore the impact of splenectomy on RIPCinduced neuroprotection and immune changes. The contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres were collected 3 days after MCAO to detect the infiltration of immune cells after RIPC and splenectomy.Results: Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that the RIPC promptly increased the percentages of CD3(+)CD8(+) cytotoxic T (Tc) cells in the spleen with a relatively delayed elevation in CD3(+)CD161(+) natural killer T (NKT) and CD3-CD45RA(+) B lymphocytes. The percentages of circulating lymphocytes are positively correlated with the percentages of splenic lymphocytes in normal rats. Interestingly, RIPC resulted in negative correlations between the percentages of splenic and circulating T lymphocytes, while the correlation between splenic and circulating B lymphocytes remained positive. For animals subjected to RIPC followed by MCAO, RIPC increased splenic volume with an expansion of splenic lymphocytes 3 days after MCAO. Furthermore, the removal of the spleen 1 day or 2 weeks before RIPC and MCAO reduced the protective effect of RIPC on ischemic brain injury and reversed the effects of RIPC on circulating immune cell composition. RIPC significantly reduced brain infiltration of Tc and NKT cells. Prior splenectomy showed no effect on immune cell infiltration after RIPC and stroke.Conclusion: These results reveal an immunomodulatory effect of the spleen, effecting mainly the spleen-derived lymphocytes, during RIPC-afforded neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000433983100002,"Capital Med Univ, Beijing Luhe Hosp, China Amer Inst Neurosci, Beijing 101100, Peoples R ChinaCapital Med Univ, Sch Basic Med Sci, Dept Pathol & Pathophysiol, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaCapital Med Univ, Xuanwu Hosp, Inst Hypoxia Med, Beijing, Peoples R China",2018,"ARTN 16710.1186/s12974-018-1190-9",Journal Article,cerebral ischemia;spleen;lymphocytes;limb remote ischemic preconditioning;focal cerebral-ischemia;limit cns inflammation;brain-damage;immune-response;spleen size;cells;contributes;recovery;activation;prevention,/2107900263/Chen-2018-Splenic responses play an important.pdf,,2024-08-16 14:07:02,825ebfc6-7a60-4df4-86a2-98f0c26f4ecb,SR-SAVI_RIC,False,96b6bdc6-13fd-4440-84f4-1342ebd6b178,María Arroyo Araujo,ef2c9df6-80e2-4ce3-b613-d2a9a4ce16c2,unclear,method not reported,2024-09-16 14:41:02,827cee69-5b5c-4b99-99ae-b99e738e61ef,low,Fig4e.Body weight of all rats from each group was measured over the 7 days after MCAO,2024-09-16 14:41:02,58be2c2d-073a-458e-9a89-4390c1f04c97,unclear,,2024-09-16 14:41:02,08b44b48-057c-4971-90a6-23f2c3f620e5,unclear,,2024-09-16 14:41:02,754c1499-085d-40a9-95a6-26054d99cc7a,unclear,,2024-09-16 14:41:02,c62574e3-a90c-44d3-8201-d5dd9a284904,high,,2024-09-16 14:41:02,69cc2271-5ebf-49d4-8e63-f87086f0ace2,low,,2024-09-16 14:41:02

After a 24 h reperfusion, behavioural testing, vascular function, NO concentration and superoxide dismutase activity in the serum were determined.

The mRNA of eNOS, nNOS, GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH), P22(phox) and xanthine oxidase (XO) in the ischemic region were detected by RT-PCR, and nitrotyrosine (Tyr-NO2) was detected using Western blot analysis. The results showed that LRIP, FA and FA+LRIP all could improve behavioural score, and increase NO mediated endothelium-dependent vasomotor responses, reduce infarction of rats subjected to IRI. Western blot and RT-PCR analyses showed that the Tyr-NO2 levels and the mRNA expression of NADPH oxidase catalytic subunit P22(phox) and XO were up-regulated in the ischemic brain, which was significantly inhibited by LRIP, FA and FA+LRIP.

Our study suggests that LRIP inhibits the number and activation of neutrophils in the rat brain and peripheral blood linked to down-regulating the activation of NADPH oxidase in neutrophils by MyD88/TRAF6/p38-MAPK pathway.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000392280500015,"China Pharmaceut Univ, Dept Pharmacol Chinese Mat Med, 639 Longmian Rd, Nanjing 211198, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaChina Pharmaceut Univ, Dept Complex Prescript TCM, Jiangsu Key Lab TCM Evaluat & Translat Res, 639 Longmian Rd, Nanjing 211198, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaChina Pharmaceut Univ, Res Dept Pharmacognosy, State Key Lab Nat Med, 639 Longmian Rd, Nanjing 211198, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",2016,"ARTN 197110.3390/ijms17121971",Journal Article,ischemic stroke;reperfusion injury;limb;neutrophil;nadph oxidase;myd88/traf6/p38-mapk pathway;cerebral-artery occlusion;ischemia/reperfusion injury;inflammatory response;down-regulation;infarct size;brain-damage;murine model;stroke;protects;rats,/1414797871/Chen-2016-Limb Remote Ischemic Postconditionin.pdf,,2024-08-16 14:07:02,825ebfc6-7a60-4df4-86a2-98f0c26f4ecb,SR-SAVI_RIC,False,1b96b68f-9627-4436-b421-db699510f2ae,sofija vojvodic,131b0b25-6371-4116-8ff2-6bc15b101262,unclear,,2024-09-19 14:05:07,83b629c3-bc33-42b6-bad8-d6cfb2887aab,unclear,,2024-09-19 14:05:07,b9d01f7f-512b-4967-94d2-8cc9aabe9da6,unclear,,2024-09-19 14:05:07,6e95bb3c-bd9f-40d4-8cd6-03f1b68002e1,unclear,,2024-09-19 14:05:07,0f252325-6208-4e45-bf6b-06366c00a9c7,unclear,,2024-09-19 14:05:07,ce3b01be-6a57-48ab-aff3-442f94f683f7,unclear,,2024-09-19 14:05:07,48730b85-fc10-443f-9861-ae136ef1f123,low,,2024-09-19 14:05:07

Y. Shan;X. S. Li;H. M. Tao,Neurological Research,Neurological Research,"Objective: Remote ischemic postconditioning (RIPostC) has been recognized as an applicable strategy for protecting against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. This study was performed to examine the effect of RIPostC on cerebral I/R and to explore its underlying mechanism.Methods: Healthy male SD rats (N = 36) were assigned randomly into 3 groups of 12 each: sham group, I/R model group and RIPostC group. Animal models were performed by filament insertion for 2 h with middle cerebral artery occlusion(MCAO) followed by 24 h of reperfusion. RIPostC was induced by 15 min occlusion of femoral arteries followed by 15 min of reperfusion for 3 cycles at the beginning of middle cerebral artery reperfusion. The neurological deficits, infarct size and brain edema were determined. Autophagy was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The protein levels of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3-II), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), serine/threonine kinase p70S6 kinase (p70S6K), and their phosphorylation (p-mTOR and p-p70S6K) in the brain tissue of the rats were determined by western blotting.Results: Our results suggested that RIPostC significantly reduced I/R-induced brain injury, as exhibited by a significantly decreased infarct size, mitigated brain edema and improved neurological deficits. RIPostC also significantly reduced the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and protein expression of Beclin 1. Much less severe neuronal injury and fewer autophagosomes were observed by TEM in the RIPostC group.Conclusions: These results suggest that RIPostC attenuates cerebral I/R injury by inhibiting autophagy through the activation of the mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway.

Ji,Brain Research,Brain Research,"Maladaptive alterations of astrocytic plasticity may cause brain edema in the acute stage of stroke and glial scar formation in the recovery stage. The present study was designed to investigate the potential regulation of limb remote ischemic post-conditioning (RIPC) on astrocytic plasticity in experimental cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Cerebral ischemia was induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) for 1 h in C57BL/6 mice, who were treated with RIPC immediately after reperfusion. The results showed that RIPC decreased hemispheric swelling, infarct volume and brain atrophy, and increased neurological function recovery and survival rates of ischemic mice at 3 and 14 d after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, respectively. Moreover, the proportion of astrocyte subtypes was adjusted by RIPC treatment, demonstrated by decreased expression of the fibrous type (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP) and increased expression of the protoplasmic type (glutamine synthetase, GS) in the ipsilateral side of the mouse brain at 14 d after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. RIPC treatment adjusted the proportion of GFAP subtypes by downregulating the protein level of GFAP alpha, as well as upregulating the GFAP delta/GFAP alpha ratio in the ipsilateral side at 3 and 14 d after reperfusion. Notably, RIPC inhibited the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activators of transcriptions 3 (p-STAT3) in the ipsilateral side at 3 and 14 d after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. Taken together, the results show that RIPC treatment could regulate reactive astrocytic plasticity and inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation to promote neurological function recovery following ischemic stroke.

Cerebral ischemia was induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) for 1 h in C57BL/6 mice, who were treated with RIPC immediately after reperfusion. The results showed that RIPC decreased hemispheric swelling, infarct volume and brain atrophy, and increased neurological function recovery and survival rates of ischemic mice at 3 and 14 d after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, respectively. Moreover, the proportion of astrocyte subtypes was adjusted by RIPC treatment, demonstrated by decreased expression of the fibrous type (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP) and increased expression of the protoplasmic type (glutamine synthetase, GS) in the ipsilateral side of the mouse brain at 14 d after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. RIPC treatment adjusted the proportion of GFAP subtypes by downregulating the protein level of GFAP alpha, as well as upregulating the GFAP delta/GFAP alpha ratio in the ipsilateral side at 3 and 14 d after reperfusion. Notably, RIPC inhibited the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activators of transcriptions 3 (p-STAT3) in the ipsilateral side at 3 and 14 d after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. Taken together, the results show that RIPC treatment could regulate reactive astrocytic plasticity and inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation to promote neurological function recovery following ischemic stroke.

Whereas ischemic pre-conditioning is irrelevant for stroke treatment, ischemic post-conditioning, and especially non-invasive remote ischemic post-conditioning (rPostC) is an innovative and potential strategy for stroke treatment. Although rPostC has been shown to induce neuroprotection in stroke models before, resulting in some clinical trials on the way, fundamental questions with regard to its therapeutic time frame and its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Hence, we herein used a model of non-invasive rPostC of hind limbs after cerebral ischemia in male C57BL6 mice, studying the optimal timing for the application of rPostC and its underlying mechanisms for up to 3 months. Mice undergoing rPostC underwent three different paradigms, starting with the first cycle of rPostC 12 h, 24 h, or 5 days after stroke induction, which is a very delayed time point of rPostC that has not been studied elsewhere. rPostC as applied within 24 h post-stroke induces reduction of infarct volume on day three. On the contrary, very delayed rPostC does not yield reduction of infarct volume on day seven when first applied on day five, albeit long-term brain injury is significantly reduced. Likewise, very delayed rPostC yields sustained neurological recovery, whereas early rPostC (i.e., <24 h) results in transient neuroprotection only. The latter is mediated via heat shock protein 70 that is a well-known signaling protein involved in the pathophysiological cellular cascade of cerebral ischemia, leading to decreased proteasomal activity and decreased post-stroke inflammation. Very delayed rPostC on day five, however, induces a pleiotropic effect, among which a stimulation of angioneurogenesis, a modulation of the ischemic extracellular milieu, and a reversal of the stroke-induced immunosuppression occur.

e3e7ad5d-3eed-499d-b6b1-5a247877e331,Very Delayed Remote Ischemic Post-conditioning Induces Sustained Neurological Recovery by Mechanisms Involving Enhanced Angioneurogenesis and Peripheral Immunosuppression Reversal,T. R. Doeppner;B. Zechmeister;B. Kaltwasser;F. Y. Jin;X. Zheng;A. Majid;V. Venkataramani;M. Bähr;D. M. Hermann,Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience,Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience,"Ischemic conditioning is defined as a transient and subcritical period of ischemia integrated in an experimental paradigm that involves a stimulus of injurious ischemia, activating endogenous tissue repair mechanisms that lead to cellular protection under pathological conditions like stroke. Whereas ischemic pre-conditioning is irrelevant for stroke treatment, ischemic post-conditioning, and especially non-invasive remote ischemic post-conditioning (rPostC) is an innovative and potential strategy for stroke treatment. Although rPostC has been shown to induce neuroprotection in stroke models before, resulting in some clinical trials on the way, fundamental questions with regard to its therapeutic time frame and its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Hence, we herein used a model of non-invasive rPostC of hind limbs after cerebral ischemia in male C57BL6 mice, studying the optimal timing for the application of rPostC and its underlying mechanisms for up to 3 months. Mice undergoing rPostC underwent three different paradigms, starting with the first cycle of rPostC 12 h, 24 h, or 5 days after stroke induction, which is a very delayed time point of rPostC that has not been studied elsewhere. rPostC as applied within 24 h post-stroke induces reduction of infarct volume on day three. On the contrary, very delayed rPostC does not yield reduction of infarct volume on day seven when first applied on day five, albeit long-term brain injury is significantly reduced. Likewise, very delayed rPostC yields sustained neurological recovery, whereas early rPostC (i.e., <24 h) results in transient neuroprotection only. The latter is mediated via heat shock protein 70 that is a well-known signaling protein involved in the pathophysiological cellular cascade of cerebral ischemia, leading to decreased proteasomal activity and decreased post-stroke inflammation. Very delayed rPostC on day five, however, induces a pleiotropic effect, among which a stimulation of angioneurogenesis, a modulation of the ischemic extracellular milieu, and a reversal of the stroke-induced immunosuppression occur. As such, very delayed rPostC appears to be an attractive tool for future adjuvant stroke treatment that deserves further preclinical attention before large clinical trials are in order, which so far have predominantly focused on early rPostC only.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000448559600001,"Univ Med Ctr Gottingen, Dept Neurol, Gottingen, GermanyUniv Duisburg Essen Med Sch, Dept Neurol, Essen, GermanyJilin Univ, Ctr Canc, Hosp 1, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R ChinaUniv Sheffield, Sheffield Inst Translat Neurosci, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, EnglandUniv Med Ctr Gottingen, Dept Hematol & Oncol, Gottingen, GermanyUniv Med Ctr Gottingen, Inst Pathol, Gottingen, Germany",2018,"ARTN 38310.3389/fncel.2018.00383",Journal Article,focal cerebral ischemia;remote ischemic post-conditioning;neuroprotection;neuroregeneration;immune response;proteasome;heat-shock proteins;reduces brain-damage;nf-kappa-b;postconditioning protects;ischemia/reperfusion injury;cerebral-ischemia;rat model;in-vivo;stroke;neuroprotection,/1727829432/Doeppner-2018-Very Delayed Remote Ischemic Pos.pdf,,2024-08-16 14:07:02,825ebfc6-7a60-4df4-86a2-98f0c26f4ecb,SR-SAVI_RIC,False,e599294d-3218-4f40-b4b9-3389481cdde2,Torsten Rackoll,9b42e82c-fad1-481f-9d59-476de4d908bb,unclear,,2024-09-24 11:30:09,13b621f3-7028-4db4-9b0b-91a5b6ac6527,unclear,,2024-09-24 11:30:09,8afba703-85db-4436-a3b5-7f2472abd352,unclear,,2024-09-24 11:30:09,ca728f45-b297-4214-aa57-9497d96fa72a,unclear,,2024-09-24 11:30:09,da89a9c5-9787-4e59-abd3-cc650af9c591,unclear,,2024-09-24 11:30:09,8b7969d7-bb2f-4d8b-92e5-ca81b7307bbc,high,,2024-09-24 11:30:09,dab5a4f7-0cba-49fb-beb5-efa045389bbf,low,no conflict of interest stated,2024-09-24 11:30:09

Methods A SD rat model of focal cerebral ischemia repcrfusion was induced by intraluminal 1 hour transient middle cerebral artery occlusion with a nylon monofilament suture. Ischemic animals were randomly assigned to 3 groups; sham group, I/R group and LRIP group, 5 animals each group. The LRIP performed immediately after reperfusion( LRIP was generated by 3 cycles of 10 minutes occlusion/10 minutes release of the bilateral hind femoral artery used rubber band). To determine whether the model of MCAO was successful, Zea longa score method was used. Rats were sacrificed on 1day or 3days after reperfusion and the brain was obtained by decapitation. Rats were evaluated for neurological deficits just before sacrifice by Garcia. Brains were harvested for infarct size estimation used 2, 3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride ( TTC ). Western blotting was used to analyze the quantitative alterations of HSP70. Immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence histochemistry were used to observe the distribution, type and number of positive cells of HSP70. Results Compared with I/R group, LRIP treatment significantly improved neurological functions( P < 0. 05 ) and decreased infract size ( P < 0. 05 ) as well as upregulated HSP70 expression. There was no statistically significant difference between LRIP and I/R group at lday ( P > 0. 05 ) except for that of 3days( P < 0. 01 ). HSP70 was localized predominantly in neurons and endolhclia cells and astrocytes in ischemic peripheral areas.

Wang;S. Qi,Mol Med Rep,Mol Med Rep,"Ischemic postconditioning has been demonstrated to alleviate brain ischemia/reperfusion-induced neuronal apoptosis; however, the protective mechanisms underlying the improved and more convenient method of remote ischemic postconditioning (RIPostC) are only recently beginning to be elucidated. Mitochondria are important in the regulation of cell apoptosis, and the B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2) homology 3 interacting‑domain death agonist (BID) promotes the insertion/oligomerization of Bcl‑2‑associated X protein into the mitochondrial outer membrane, leading to the release of proapoptotic proteins from the mitochondria. The present study hypothesized that RIPostC targets the BID‑mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway to exert neuroprotective effects, and the optimal time window for RIPostC application was investigated. RIPostC was conducted as follows: Three 10‑min cycles of bilateral femoral artery occlusion with intervals of 10 min reperfusion after 0, 10 or 30 min of brain reperfusion. The results revealed that reperfusion induced significant activation of BID, via proteolytic cleavage and translocation to the mitochondria, as determined using western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining. Mitochondrial release of cytochrome c was additionally detected during BID activation, all of which were inhibited by the application of RIPostC. When RIPostC was applied during reperfusion, it demonstrated a significant protective effect. Furthermore, the infarct volume, neurological function and the degree of neuronal apoptosis were improved with application of RIPostC.

However, there is no report on its therapeutic potential in a physiologically relevant embolic stroke model (embolic middle cerebral artery occlusion) in combination with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA).Methods-We tested remote ischemic perconditioning therapy (RIPerC) at 2 hours after embolic middle cerebral artery occlusion in the mouse with and without intravenous tPA at 4 hours. We assessed cerebral blood flow up to 6 hours, neurological deficits, injury size, and phosphorylation of Akt (Serine(473)) as a prosurvival signal in the ischemic hemisphere at 48 hours poststroke.Results-RIPerC therapy alone improved the cerebral blood flow and neurological outcomes. tPA alone at 4 hours did not significantly improve the neurological outcome even after successful thrombolysis. Individual treatments with RIPerC and intravenous tPA reduced the infarct size (25.7% and 23.8%, respectively). Combination therapy of RIPerC and tPA resulted in additive effects in further improving the neurological outcome and reducing the infarct size (50%). All the therapeutic treatments upregulated phosphorylation of Akt in the ischemic hemisphere.Conclusions-RIPerC is effective alone after embolic middle cerebral artery occlusion and has additive effects in combination with intravenous tPA.

METHODS: One hundred twenty-eight Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned into eight groups (n=16 each): MCAO, Control, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropulxanthine (DPCPX, Adenosine A1 receptor antagonist), RIPC, DPCPX+RIPC, Vehicle+RIPC, 2-chloro-N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine (CCPA, Adenosine A1 receptor agonist) and CCPA+DPCPX groups. All animals underwent right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2 h. Limb RIPC consisted of three cycles of 5-minute ischemia followed by 5-minute reperfusion in right hind-limb by tourniquet application. Neurological deficit scores were evaluated 24 h after reperfusion, and then the infarct volume was assessed with diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Inflammation was assessed by serum tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF(alpha)) and NO; oxidative stress was estimated by malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxyalkenals (4-HAD), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and GSH. RESULTS: Animals in the RIPC, Vehicle+RIPC and CCPA groups developed lower neurological deficit scores and smaller brain infarct volumes than the Control group (P<0.01). Animals in the DPCPX, DPCPX+RIPC and CCPA+DPCPX groups developed higher neurological deficit scores and larger brain infarct volumes than the RIPC, Vehicle+RIPC and CCPA groups (P<0.01). DPCPX abolished the protective effects of RIPC and CCPA. RIPC or CCPA induced a significant increase in brain MnSOD (manganese SOD) activity and NO generation, and this activity was abolished by DPCPX pretreatment. RIPC or CCPA induced a significant reduction (P<0.05) in the GSH and MDA+4HDA concentration and an accumulation in the GSSG concentration in both compartments (serum and tissue) as compared with the MCAO group. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that limb RIPC induced by noninvasive tourniquet reduces cerebral ischemic injury in rats, and the effect of neuroprotection may depend on the activation of adenosine A1 receptors.

Infarct volume was investigated by 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, and neuronal survival was evaluated by Nissl staining.

Kitagawa;M. Saitoh;K. Ishizuka;S. Shimizu,JOURNAL OF STROKE & CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES,JOURNAL OF STROKE & CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES,"Background: Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) induces protection in focal cerebral ischemia. The conditioning is divided into pre-, per-, and postconditioning. However, the mechanisms of RIC remain unknown. Objectives: This study aimed to determine the most effective subtype of RIC. We also examined involvement of collateral circulation on RIC. Methods: Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed with nylon sutures in adult C57BL/6 mice under the monitoring of cerebral blood flow (CBF). Fifty mice were divided into 5 groups: MCAO control group, delayed pre-RIC group (RIC 24 hours before MCAO), early pre-RIC group (RIC 5 minutes before MCAO), per-RIC group (RIC during MCAO), and post-RIC group (RIC 5 minutes after MCAO). In other middle cerebral artery (MCA) control and per-RIC groups, collateral circulation was visualized with latex compound perfusion. Results: After MCAO, CBF was reduced by 80% in all groups. At the end of MCAO, relative increase in CBF in per-RIC group was significantly greater than that in MCA control, whereas the infarct volume in per-RIC group was significantly smaller than that in other groups. The diameter of leptomeningeal anastomosis was larger in the per-RIC group than that in the control group.

In this study, the expression RGMa and IL-1 beta, IL-6 are investigated to estimate the therapeutic benefits of various postconditioning strategies after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. The study consists of the sham-operated group and five treatment groups: ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), two proximate ischemic postconditioning (IPC-S and IPC-M), remote postconditioning (RIPC) and delayed postconditioning (DIPC) groups. We find that rats in IPC and RIPC groups exhibit significantly less neural deficit and lower infarct volume than that in I/R and DIPC groups after ischemia/reperfusion. Moreover, in ischemic cortex and hippocampus, the mRNA level of RGMa is much lower in IPC and RIPC groups. Immunohistochemical analysis indicates that the expression of RGMa, IL-1 beta and IL-6 are reduced in IPC and RIPC groups (especially in IPC-S group). Furthermore, neurofilament staining reveals that the rats in IPC and RIPC groups have less axonal injury than that in I/R and DIPC groups.

However, widely used invasive limb remote ischemic per-conditioning (LRPC-I) is traumatic, limiting the possibility of long-term application and making it more difficult to achieve the conversion from basic research to clinical practice. Because of this, if non-invasive limb remote ischemic per-conditioning (LRPC-N) has the same effect of brain protection as LRPC-I, it may be more beneficial to clinical practice. Methods: The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) ischemia-reperfusion injury model was established by the suture method in mice.

Wu;K. Liu;Y. Zhang;G. Ma;L. Wang,J Neurol Sci,J Neurol Sci,"It has been reported that remote ischemic postconditioning was able to protect from a harmful ischemia occurring in brain. In the present study, we investigated the role of p38 MAPK signal pathway in the process of neuroprotection and anti-apoptosis following remote limb ischemic postconditioning on rat focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into four groups: the sham-operated group, I/R group, limb ischemic postconditioning (LPostC) group, and LPostC+SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) group. Focal ischemia was induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Limb ischemic postconditioning was implemented by brief cycles of femoral artery occlusion. At 24h after modeling, we analyzed the neurological deficit score, assessed the cerebral tissue morphology by H-E staining, and evaluated neuronal apoptosis by TUNEL staining. The protein expression levels of p-p38 or p-ATF2 (phospho-activating transcription factor 2) in the penumbra region were detected by western blotting or immunohistochemical staining. Our findings revealed that LPostC relieved cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by decreasing neurological score, improving neuronal morphological changes in the ischemic penumbra area, and reducing neuronal apoptosis. In addition, LPostC or LPostC+SB203580 attenuated the increase in p-p38 and p-ATF2 levels in ischemia/reperfusion brain tissue.

Zong;H. Yang;T. Wang,Behav Brain Res,Behav Brain Res,"Cerebral ischemia is a primary cause of human death and long-term disability. Previous studies have suggested that remote ischemic post-conditioning (RIPC) is a potential useful tool for cerebral ischemic treatment. However, the protective mechanism of RIPC is not very clear. This study verified the hypothesis that, in remote post-conditioning of cerebral ischemic rats, down-regulation of aquaporin 4 (AQP4), which is an important player for water hemostasis in astrocytes, could attenuate cerebral damage after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). In this study, RIPC model was established after MCAO. Each hind limb of rat was clamped by small rubber tubes for 10 min, and then the tubes were opened for 10 min. The clamping and opening were operated for a total of three cycles to block the hind limbs blood flow. The results showed that, RIPC could significantly improve neurological function, decrease the percentage of the infarct volume and edema, and elevate the integrity of blood-brain barrier (BBB). In addition, the numbers of AQP4 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive cells were significantly lower in the RIPC group. Moreover, we found that AQP4 expression decreased in response to ischemia/reperfusion in the RIPC group. Our findings indicated that RIPC could attenuate focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, and the neuroprotective mechanism was related with the down-regulation of AQP4 in astrocytes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25907740,"Department of Morphology Lab, Chengdu Medical College, Sichuan 610500, China.

c4312b39-b6b7-493f-9f46-551980edb381,The changes of systemic immune responses during the neuroprotection induced by remote ischemic postconditioning against focal cerebral ischemia in mice,C. Y. Liu;J. Yang;C. C. Zhang;X. K. Geng;H. Zhao,Neurological Research,Neurological Research,"Objective: Remote limb ischemic postconditioning (RIPostC) protects the brain from damage induced by transient focal ischemia/reperfusion. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Methods: RIPostC induced by 10 min of occlusion and another 10 min releasing of blood flow for three cycles in the hind limbs was performed immediately after the reperfusion in a focal ischemia mice model. Neurological scores, immune cell population in the blood, spleen and lymph node, and inflammatory factors in the blood and brain were analyzed 2 days after the reperfusion. Results: Our results demonstrate that RIPostC reduced cerebral injuries and improved neurological functions 2 days after reperfusion. RIPostC significantly inhibited the reduction in the percentage of CD4 T cells in the spleen and lymph node, CD8 T cells in the blood and lymph node, and natural killer T (NKT) cells in the spleen by flow cytometry analysis. RIPostC attenuated the increase of B cells and NK cells in the spleen and noninflammatory monocytes in the blood.

Methods: We generated a rat model of noninvasive RIPC by four repeated cycles of brief blood flow constriction (5 min) in the hindlimbs using a tourniquet. Blood was collected 1 h after preconditioning and 3 days after brain reperfusion. The impact of RIPC on immune cell and cytokine profiles prior to and after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was assessed. Results: Remote ischemic preconditioning protects against focal ischemia and preserves neurological functions 3 days after stroke. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that RIPC ameliorates the post-MCAO reduction of CD3(+)CD8(+) T cells and abolishes the reduction of CD3(+)/CD161a(+) NKT cells in the blood. In addition, RIPC robustly elevates the percentage of B cells in peripheral blood, thereby reversing the reduction in the B-cell population after stroke. RIPC also markedly elevates the percentage of CD43(+)/CD172a(+) noninflammatory resident monocytes, without any impact on the percentage of CD43(-)/CD172a(+) inflammatory monocytes.

In this study, we directly investigated pial collateral flow augmentation due to RIPerC during distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in rats. Blood flow through pial collaterals between the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and the MCA was assessed in male Sprague Dawley rats using in vivo laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) and two photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM) during distal MCAo.

Our study and other recent investigations have shown that AKT-dependent autophagy contributes to the neuroprotection afforded by limb remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) in experimental stroke. However, how AKT triggers RIC-based autophagy and whether RIC-afforded autophagy is beneficial for mitochondrial function after cerebral ischemia remains unclear. The disruption of the Bcl-2/Beclin1 complex has been reported to trigger autophagy formation in the condition of Bcl-2 phosphorylation at Ser70. We investigated whether Bcl-2 phosphorylation triggers RIC-based autophagy and thereby confers RIC-induced neuroprotection against mitochondrial injury, using a transient cerebral ischemic rat model. We demonstrated that rats undergoing RIC treatment 30 min after the onset of ischemia (I-30) and at reperfusion (R-0) significantly upregulated Bcl-2 phosphorylation. Immunoprecipitation revealed that RIC increased dissociation of the Bcl-2/Beclin1 complex, leading to a higher level of autophagy than in ischemia/reperfusion rats. Furthermore, AKT activation was shown to play a critical role in regulating Bcl-2-mediated autophagy, as an AKT inhibitor (LY294002, AKTi) administered 30 min prior to ischemia significantly suppressed Bcl-2 phosphorylation and Bcl-2/Beclin1 complex dissociation, thereby reducing autophagy in RIC rats. Blocking Bcl-2 phosphorylation-dependent autophagy with AKTi suppressed RIC-afforded protection on mitochondrial potential and mitochondrial-dependent cell death effector pathway.

An ischemic stroke model was generated by 90-minute occlusion of right MCA (n=42). Twelve rats were used as control for studying edema and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Remote post-conditioning was conducted immediately after MCA occlusion in the bilateral lower limb by occluding and releasing the femoral artery for three cycles; each occlusion and release lasted for 10 minutes. After 24 hours of reperfusion, the cerebral infarct volumes were quantified by 2,3,4-triphenytetrazolium-chloride, brain water content was determined by dry/wet weight method, and damage to the BBB was determined by Evans blue extravasation.Results: Remote post-conditioning significantly reduced brain infarct damage (P<0.0001). Brain edema was significantly (P<0.01) reduced after stroke in the remote post-conditioning group. BBB leakage was significantly reduced in the remote post-conditioning group when compared to the control ischemic groups (P<0.05).Conclusion: These results provide evidence that remote post-conditioning, which was initiated after ischemia and before reperfusion, protects against brain injury in experimental ischemic stroke.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000291304400011,"Capital Med Univ, Xuanwu Hosp, Inst Hypoxia Med, Beijing 100053, Peoples R ChinaWeifang Med Coll, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Weifang, Peoples R ChinaWayne State Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, Detroit, MI USACapital Med Univ, Xuanwu Hosp, Inst Cerebrovasc Dis, Beijing 100053, Peoples R China",2011,10.1179/016164111x13007856084241,Journal Article,ischemia/reperfusion injury;remote post-conditioning;stroke;myocardial-infarction;reperfusion;protects;heart;dysfunction;mechanisms;tolerance;occlusion;distance;humans,/2139204316/Ren-2011-Remote ischemic post-conditioning red.pdf,,2024-08-16 14:07:02,825ebfc6-7a60-4df4-86a2-98f0c26f4ecb,SR-SAVI_RIC,False,96b6bdc6-13fd-4440-84f4-1342ebd6b178,María Arroyo Araujo,06aca05e-9365-40a0-b12b-86465f1cbebf,unclear,,2024-09-19 12:33:05,721c682e-9a73-4b7a-8d99-7c83fc113d48,unclear,,2024-09-19 12:33:05,f452af59-2cd9-403a-b143-bbe8003712cf,low,,2024-09-19 12:33:05,f183abd8-b3bc-4c60-b44d-dcc4d38de5ed,unclear,,2024-09-19 12:33:05,f8dc286b-a773-48c6-8639-3192b8128b32,low,,2024-09-19 12:33:05,c4d6c0fe-01e4-4d81-aa0b-f667532a2ca3,unclear,,2024-09-19 12:33:05,aafaed13-3464-4e75-8067-83fc9adb3c33,unclear,no conflict of interest statement,2024-09-19 12:33:05

In this study, we explored the effect of anesthetics (chloral hydrate and Zoletil) on the ability of RIPC to protect the brain from injury caused by ischemia and reperfusion. We found that RIPC without anesthesia resulted in statistically significant decrease in neurological deficit 24 h after ischemia, but did not affect the volume of brain injury.

The protective effects observed after RIPC with chloral hydrate or Zoletil were similar to those observed when only the respective anesthetic was used. RIPC was accompanied by significant increase in the level of brain proteins associated with the induction of ischemic tolerance such as pGSK-3 beta, BDNF, and HSP70.

We conclude that RIPC, chloral hydrate, and Zoletil produce a significant neuroprotective effect, but the simultaneous use of anesthetics with RIPC does not enhance the degree of neuroprotection.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000410704200003,"Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Belozersky Inst Physicochem Biol, Moscow 119992, RussiaLomonosov Moscow State Univ, Int Laser Ctr, Moscow 119992, RussiaLomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Bioengn & Bioinformat, Moscow 119992, RussiaLomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Fundamental Med, Moscow 119992, RussiaLomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Phys, Moscow 119992, Russia",2017,10.1134/S0006297917090036,Journal Article,ischemia;brain;remote preconditioning;hind limb;chloral hydrate;zoletil;focal cerebral-ischemia;nmda receptor antagonists;reduces infarct size;hippocampal-neurons;chloral hydrate;rats;tolerance;injury;brain;mitochondrial,/2528096472/Silachev-2017-Effect of anesthetics on efficie.pdf,,2024-08-16 14:07:02,825ebfc6-7a60-4df4-86a2-98f0c26f4ecb,SR-SAVI_RIC,False,96b6bdc6-13fd-4440-84f4-1342ebd6b178,María Arroyo Araujo,911b9a08-807e-4264-8a6a-6d5eee52d79d,unclear,,2024-09-22 18:29:16,0792d76b-aaad-4a40-8e16-dc3b57e27bb7,unclear,,2024-09-22 18:29:16,5d4575cd-03e7-4ede-abef-a4213feeeeaa,unclear,,2024-09-22 18:29:16,60816a19-da1b-42dc-bf76-2dfe5a032561,unclear,,2024-09-22 18:29:16,1839ffaa-9a8b-41cf-ba4e-08486d0a7604,unclear,,2024-09-22 18:29:16,e278f0a8-4f83-4c03-974c-b53a3416c158,unclear,,2024-09-22 18:29:16,ee72a8d2-1e84-4779-a491-d5c415d1216f,unclear,no conflict statement,2024-09-22 18:29:16

Because opening of the mitochondria K(ATP) channel is crucial for cell apoptosis, we hypothesized that the neuroprotective effect of DRIPost may be associated with K(ATP) channels. In the present study, the neuroprotective effects of DRIPost were investigated using adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were exposed to 90 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by 72 hours of reperfusion. Delayed remote ischemic postconditioning was performed with three cycles of bilateral femoral artery occlusion/reperfusion for 5 minutes at 3 or 6 hours after reperfusion. Neurologic deficit scores and infarct volumes were assessed, and cellular apoptosis was monitored by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick-end labeling. Our results showed that DRIPost applied at 6 hours after reperfusion exerted neuroprotective effects. The K(ATP) opener, diazoxide, protected rat brains from ischemic injury, while the K(ATP) blocker, 5-hydroxydecanote, reversed the neuroprotective effects of DRIPost.

Wang;X. F. Zhang;Q. Ding;B. Hu;Y. N. Xie;X. Y. Li;Q. Z. Yang;L. Z. Xiong,Anesthesia and Analgesia,Anesthesia and Analgesia,"BACKGROUND: Remote ischemic postconditioning (RPostC) is an emerging concept for cerebral infarction protection, and its potential protective mechanisms have not been well established. We attempted to investigate the implications of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and delta protein kinase C (delta PKC) in neuroprotection induced by RPostC in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia, and also to explore a possible relationship between ROS and epsilon PKC.METHODS: Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion using the intraluminal filament technique in male rats. RPostC was generated by 3 10-minute cycles of femoral artery occlusion/reperfusion on the right limb at the onset of middle cerebral artery reperfusion. RPostC was performed alone or with pretreatment of N-acetylcysteine, a ROS scavenger. In separate group, TAT-delta V1-1, a delta PKC-selective peptide inhibitor, was administered at the onset of reperfusion. Brain ischemic injury was evaluated by neurologic scores, infarction volumes, and TUNEL staining. Moreover, the activation of delta PKC in the ischemic penumbra was investigated by Western blot after reperfusion.RESULTS: RPostC improved neurologic outcome, reduced infarct size, and inhibited neuronal apoptosis as well as suppressed the activation of delta PKC after reperfusion. Moreover, systemic delivery of TAT-delta V1-1 conferred neuroprotection against cerebral reperfusion injury at the onset of reperfusion. Pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine not only completely prevented all aspects of RPostC-induced neuroprotection, but also reversed RPostC-induced inhibition of delta PKC activation after reperfusion.CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that RPostC performed in one limb alleviated reperfusion injury after focal cerebral ischemia through ROS-mediated inhibition of endogenous delta PKC activation signaling cascade in an in vivo rat model of focal cerebral ischemia.

Therefore, potential protective effects of limb ischemic preconditioning (LIP) on subsequent ischemic injury of the brain were investigated by evaluating anti-inflammatory effects and apoptosis of pyramidal neurons in the CAI hippocampus. One hundred and eight Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group (n=54) and the LIP group (n=54). A thread was used to occlude the middle cerebral artery in the MCAO group and the LIP group animals were pretreated with LIP followed by MCAO. In the two groups, nine samples were collected at each time-point of 0, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h after MCAO to detect IL-6 and IL-17 and their mRNA levels. Neurological severity scores (NSS) were examined before the animals were sacrificed. Compared with the LIP group, cerebral histopathological changes in the MCAO group were most distinct and significantly more infiltrated inflammatory and apoptotic neuronal cells were observed at 24, 48 and 72 h post-surgery. IL-17 and IL-6 mRNA levels analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (qRT-PCR) were significantly reduced in the LIP group compared with the MCAO group at the 12, 24 and 48 h time-points.

e70cce82-3238-4a46-a1dd-13b7d85b9587,The Chronic Protective Effects of Limb Remote Preconditioning and the Underlying Mechanisms Involved in Inflammatory Factors in Rat Stroke,D. T. Wei;C. C. Ren;X. Y. Chen;H. Zhao,PLoS ONE,PLoS ONE,"We recently demonstrated that limb remote preconditioning (LRP) protects against focal ischemia measured 2 days post-stroke. Here, we studied whether LRP provides long-term protection and improves neurological function. We also investigated whether LRP transmits its protective signaling via the afferent nerve pathways from the preconditioned limb to the ischemic brain and whether inflammatory factors are involved in LRP, including the novel galectin-9/Tim-3 inflammatory cell signaling pathway, which induces cell death in lymphocytes. LRP in the left hind femoral artery was performed immediately before stroke. LRP reduced brain injury size both at 2 days and 60 days post-stroke and improved behavioral outcomes for up to 2 months.

Y. Chen;H. Zhao,PLoS ONE,PLoS ONE,"We recently demonstrated that limb remote preconditioning (LRP) protects against focal ischemia measured 2 days post-stroke. Here, we studied whether LRP provides long-term protection and improves neurological function. We also investigated whether LRP transmits its protective signaling via the afferent nerve pathways from the preconditioned limb to the ischemic brain and whether inflammatory factors are involved in LRP, including the novel galectin-9/Tim-3 inflammatory cell signaling pathway, which induces cell death in lymphocytes. LRP in the left hind femoral artery was performed immediately before stroke. LRP reduced brain injury size both at 2 days and 60 days post-stroke and improved behavioral outcomes for up to 2 months. The sensory nerve inhibitors capsaicin and hexamethonium, a ganglion blocker, abolished the protective effects of LRP. In addition, LRP inhibited edema formation and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability measured 2 days post-stroke. Western blot and immunostaining analysis showed that LRP inhibited protein expression of both galectin-9 and T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3), which were increased after stroke.

Fan;X. G. Zhu;Z. Y. Gao,International Journal of Molecular Medicine,International Journal of Molecular Medicine,"Cerebral ischemia is a leading cause of death and disability. A previous study indicated that remote ischemic postconditioning (RIP) in the treatment of cerebral ischemia reduces ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, the underlying mechanism is not well understood. In the present study, the authors hypothesized that the protective effect of RIP on neurological damage is mediated by exosomes that are released by endothelial cells in femoral arteries. To test this, right middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion with RIP was performed in rats. In addition, an I/R injury cell model was tested that included human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and SH-SY5Y cells. Both the in vivo and in vitro models were examined for injury.

Fan;X. G. Zhu;Z. Y. Gao,International Journal of Molecular Medicine,International Journal of Molecular Medicine,"Cerebral ischemia is a leading cause of death and disability. A previous study indicated that remote ischemic postconditioning (RIP) in the treatment of cerebral ischemia reduces ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, the underlying mechanism is not well understood. In the present study, the authors hypothesized that the protective effect of RIP on neurological damage is mediated by exosomes that are released by endothelial cells in femoral arteries. To test this, right middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion with RIP was performed in rats. In addition, an I/R injury cell model was tested that included human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and SH-SY5Y cells. Both the in vivo and in vitro models were examined for injury. Markers of exosomes (CD63, HSP70 and TSG101) were assessed by immunohistochemistry, western blot analysis and flow cytometry.

Ren,Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology,Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology,"As remote limb preconditioning (RPC) ameliorates brain damage after ischemic cerebral stroke (ICS), the purpose of the present study was to explore the molecular mechanisms in the course of RPC. Results of TUNEL staining and cleaved caspase-3 expression showed that ischemia-induced neuronal apoptosis was inhibited by RPC. The expression changes in cleaved caspase-8, cFLIP, Bid itself, and its truncated form represented that RPC suppressed the activation of extrinsic apoptotic pathway during ICS. Then, the level of cytoplasmic cytochrome c was also decreased by RPC. In addition, RPC might partially suppress TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced extrinsic apoptosis through downregulation of TRAIL death receptors and upregulation of TRAIL decoy receptors. As a counterproof, immunoneutralization of TRAIL in dMCAO rats resulted in significant restraint of tissue damage and in a marked functional recovery.

Ren,Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology,Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology,"As remote limb preconditioning (RPC) ameliorates brain damage after ischemic cerebral stroke (ICS), the purpose of the present study was to explore the molecular mechanisms in the course of RPC. Results of TUNEL staining and cleaved caspase-3 expression showed that ischemia-induced neuronal apoptosis was inhibited by RPC. The expression changes in cleaved caspase-8, cFLIP, Bid itself, and its truncated form represented that RPC suppressed the activation of extrinsic apoptotic pathway during ICS. Then, the level of cytoplasmic cytochrome c was also decreased by RPC. In addition, RPC might partially suppress TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced extrinsic apoptosis through downregulation of TRAIL death receptors and upregulation of TRAIL decoy receptors. As a counterproof, immunoneutralization of TRAIL in dMCAO rats resulted in significant restraint of tissue damage and in a marked functional recovery. Our data complemented the knowledge of RPC neuroprotective mechanism and provided new evidence for its clinical application.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000392407200017,"Fudan Univ, Shanghai Hosp 5, Dept Neurol, 801 Heqing Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China",2017,10.1007/s10571-016-0360-5,Journal Article,remote limb preconditioning;ischemic cerebral stoke;neuronal apoptosis;trail-receptors;programmed cell-death;nervous-system;stroke;ischemia;brain;populations;tolerance;statement;protects;necrosis,/3880829887/Xu-2017-Remote Limb Preconditioning Generates.pdf,,2024-08-16 14:07:02,825ebfc6-7a60-4df4-86a2-98f0c26f4ecb,SR-SAVI_RIC,False,96b6bdc6-13fd-4440-84f4-1342ebd6b178,María Arroyo Araujo,eca58f8e-3b0a-4223-b7ed-348d8163b205,unclear,no method reported,2024-09-18 10:27:42,a06730f4-f186-4252-9c3e-28aa9c688d04,unclear,,2024-09-18 10:27:42,86d9e4ce-c0df-48f6-bb05-371832d9d764,unclear,,2024-09-18 10:27:42,a883e1d1-ccb2-4a36-9068-257a808491f7,unclear,,2024-09-18 10:27:42,d87b519e-a3dd-4758-b7a7-ec8b04802328,unclear,,2024-09-18 10:27:42,5f06c8be-e3f7-45dd-865e-ee6033f3129c,unclear,,2024-09-18 10:27:42,3809e63d-a106-442c-a082-67927d4860f3,unclear,no conflict of interest statement,2024-09-18 10:27:42

Methods: The diabetic rats models were induced by injecting streptozotocin into abdominal cavity. I/R rats models were made by MCAO with thread. Forty male SD rats models were assigned to 4 groups: control group; sham operation group; I/R group; RPostC group (n = 10). 6 h after the reperfusion, the brains were obtained for HE staining. The mitchondria were isolated and content of MDA, the activities of SOD, Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase and GSH-Px were tested. Morphological changes of neuronal mitochondria were observed by electronic microscope. Results: In the I/R group, the content of mitchondria MDA[(4.99 +/- 1.25) nmol/mgprot] were markedly increased (P < 0. 01) and the activities of mitochondria SOD [(72. 52 +/- 13. 07) U/mg], Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase [(3.17 +/- 0.34) mumolPi/(mg . h)], Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase[(1.56 +/- 0.23) mumolPi/(mg . h)] and GSH-Px[(22.66 +/- 5.29) U/mg)] were decreased significantly (all P < 0.01).

As hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) is neuroprotective in stroke and mediates neuroinflammation, we tested the hypothesis that HIF-1 alpha is a key factor of RIPC against stroke by mediating inflammation.Methods and Results-Stroke was induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats, and RIPC was conducted in both hind limbs. The HIF-1 alpha mRNA was examined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction after RIPC. In addition, inflammatory cytokines in the peripheral blood and brain were measured using the AimPlex multiplex immunoassays. Data showed that RIPC reduced the infarct size, improved neurological functions, and increased HIF-1 alpha mRNA levels, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-10 protein levels in the peripheral blood. Intraperitoneal injection of the HIF activator, dimethyloxaloylglycine, reduced the infarct size and inhibited interferon-c protein levels, while promoting IL-4 and IL-10 protein levels, while decreasing interferon-c protein levels in both the peripheral blood and ischemic brain. In addition, injection of dimethyloxaloylglycine had a synergistic effect with RIPC on reducing infarction and improving neurological functions, as well as decreasing interferon-c in the peripheral blood and ischemic brain.

Here, we employed a focal ischemic stroke mouse model to test the hypothesis that poststroke collateral circulation as a potent mechanism of action underlying the therapeutic effects of immediate RIPC. During reperfusion of cerebral ischemia, the mice were randomly assigned to receive RIPC, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) as a positive control, or no treatment. At 24hr, we found RIPC and G-CSF increased monocytes/macrophages in the dorsal brain surface and in the spleen, coupled with enhanced leptomeningeal collateral flow compared with nontreatment group. Blood monocytes depletion by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) significantly limited the neuroprotection of RIPC or G-CSF treatment. The protein expression of proangiogenic factors such as Ang-2 was increased by ischemia, but treatment with either RIPC or G-CSF showed no further upregulation.

Here, we employed a focal ischemic stroke mouse model to test the hypothesis that poststroke collateral circulation as a potent mechanism of action underlying the therapeutic effects of immediate RIPC. During reperfusion of cerebral ischemia, the mice were randomly assigned to receive RIPC, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) as a positive control, or no treatment. At 24hr, we found RIPC and G-CSF increased monocytes/macrophages in the dorsal brain surface and in the spleen, coupled with enhanced leptomeningeal collateral flow compared with nontreatment group. Blood monocytes depletion by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) significantly limited the neuroprotection of RIPC or G-CSF treatment. The protein expression of proangiogenic factors such as Ang-2 was increased by ischemia, but treatment with either RIPC or G-CSF showed no further upregulation. Thus, immediate RIPC confers neuroprotection, in part, by enhancing leptomeningeal collateral circulation in a mouse model of ischemic stroke.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000467240800045,"Capital Med Univ, Dept Neurobiol, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaCapital Med Univ, Xuanwu Hosp, Beijing Key Lab Hypoxia Conditioning Translat Med, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaCapital Med Univ, Beijing Inst Brain Disorders, Ctr Stroke, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaWayne State Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, Detroit, MI USAUniv S Florida, Dept Neurosurg & Brain Repair, Tampa, FL USACapital Med Univ, Xuanwu Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Beijing 100053, Peoples R China",2019,10.1002/jcp.27858,Journal Article,animal models;collateral circulation;ischemic stroke;monocytes;macrophages;remote ischemic postconditioning;myocardial-infarction;brain;trial;neuroprotection;mechanisms;mouse,/2507095926/Zhang-2019-Immediate remote ischemic postcondi.pdf,,2024-08-16 14:07:02,825ebfc6-7a60-4df4-86a2-98f0c26f4ecb,SR-SAVI_RIC,False,96b6bdc6-13fd-4440-84f4-1342ebd6b178,María Arroyo Araujo,bcd27e04-64d5-4b96-a35e-22bb4103b19d,unclear,no method reported,2024-09-16 08:15:50,a7dcbf57-67fb-4ed4-af19-44c7eb62e700,unclear,no method reported,2024-09-16 08:15:50,bd58f815-0d6c-451d-a2da-bc5d50f997c0,unclear,,2024-09-16 08:15:50,fcad89e3-41e6-4fb7-a329-d0e75fb23f17,unclear,,2024-09-16 08:15:50,12f91470-81da-4ad9-a711-6c866caca78e,unclear,no method reported,2024-09-16 08:15:50,7cc3aa94-bbb3-4809-b338-e093fc59250d,high,no mortality reported,2024-09-16 08:15:50,2dee7e04-3c31-4da5-aa20-fc6145affa77,low,,2024-09-16 08:15:50

Four groups of rats were included in this experiment: the sham group, the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group, the RIPC group, and the AG490 group. As an inhibitor of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), AG490 was used after MCAO in the AG490 group to explore the role of JAK2/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) after CIRI. Brain tissue was collected for evaluation after 2 h of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion. ELISA for interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, western blot for phosphorylated-JAK2 and phosphorylated-STAT3, the neurological severity score and Longa scoring system for neurological deficit evaluation, triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining for cerebral infarction, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling staining for apoptotic cells in the brain tissue were performed. Neurological function in the RIPC group was notably better than that in the MCAO group.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety adult male rats were randomly assigned into 5 groups including a sham operation group (S) and ischemia-reperfusion group (I/R). Focal cerebral I/R was induced by right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). I/R+remote ischemic postconditioning (I/R+RIPoC), I/R+RIPoC+ mitophagy inhibitor Mdivi-1 (I/R+RIPoC+M), and I/R+RIPoC+ normal saline (I/R+RIPoC+NS) groups all received 3 cycles of 10 minutes reperfusion followed by 10 minutes ischemia in bilateral femoral arteries at the beginning of cerebral reperfusion. I/R+RIPoC+M received mitochondrial division inhibitor (Mdivi-1) before ischemia and after 24h of reperfusion, neurological deficit scores (NDSs) were measured and rats were then sacrificed. Brain was removed and size of the infarct was determined. Apoptosis index and LC3-II/I ratio, Parkin/DJ-1 proteins expression, SOD activity, MDA and 15-F2t-Isoprostane content in cerebral ischemic penumbra were studied.

RESULTS: In experimental groups the NDSs, percentage of cerebral infarct size, apoptosis index, LC3-II/I ratio, MDA and 15-F2t-Isoprostane content significantly increased and Parkin/DJ-1 proteins were up-regulated (p<0.05). In I/R+RIPoC and I/R+RIPoC+NS groups, NDSs, percentage of cerebral infarct size, apoptosis index, MDA and 15-F2t-Isoprostane content decreased significantly while LC3-II/I ratio and SOD activity increased compared to I/R group.

Meanwhile, the result of Q-PCR and western blot revealed that the overexpression of HIF-1 alpha induced by IRI could be notably suppressed by LRIP treatment.Conclusions: LRIP exhibits a protective effect against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion and the possible mechanism is associated with the suppression of HIF-1 alpha in stroke rats.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000367425800001,"Chengdu Med Coll, Dept Morphol Lab, Chengdu 610500, Sichuan, Peoples R ChinaChengdu Med Coll, Dept Grad, Chengdu 610500, Sichuan, Peoples R ChinaKunming Med Univ, Inst Neurosci, Kunming 650031, Peoples R ChinaWest China Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R ChinaWest China Hosp, Inst Neurol Dis, State Key Lab Biotherapy, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R ChinaSichuan Univ, West China Sch Preclin & Forens Med, Dept Histol Embryol & Neurobiol, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China",2015,"ARTN 9710.1186/s12868-015-0235-6",Journal Article,cerebral ischemia-reperfusion;lrip;mcao;hif-1 alpha;artery occlusion;focal ischemia;brain-damage;inflammation;neuroprotection;responses;cells,/0939815705/Zong-2015-Limb remote ischemic postconditionin.pdf,,2024-08-16 14:07:02,825ebfc6-7a60-4df4-86a2-98f0c26f4ecb,SR-SAVI_RIC,False,96b6bdc6-13fd-4440-84f4-1342ebd6b178,María Arroyo Araujo,54b245a8-aa4f-4cde-9ed7-158dab9dd820,unclear,no method reported,2024-09-16 08:55:34,bb271d8e-1a6a-43df-b782-c48dad41f4ed,unclear,,2024-09-16 08:55:34,e3cd76f4-daec-4943-8e7b-27c5d648bab2,unclear,,2024-09-16 08:55:34,061e2c74-dbbd-45ab-8796-fcbd1a894115,unclear,,2024-09-16 08:55:34,9ce57531-5d81-41be-863a-6d8731cd0e70,unclear,,2024-09-16 08:55:34,fcec04d5-482b-4ad2-bfea-f76515fcd171,high,,2024-09-16 08:55:34,52cdab14-aeaf-48a7-93f8-b660f556756c,low,,2024-09-16 08:55:34
