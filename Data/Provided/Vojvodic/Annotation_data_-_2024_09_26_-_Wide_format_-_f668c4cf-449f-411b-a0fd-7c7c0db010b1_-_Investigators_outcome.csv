Gottlieb,Journal of Neuroscience Research,Journal of Neuroscience Research,"This study provides clear evidence that the factor inducing tolerance to ischemia is transmitted via the circulating blood. By using the remote ischemia and the cross-circulation model, the tolerance to ischemia was transmitted from donor to recipient. For this study, the following experimental groups were designed: I, sham control group; II, group of tolerant hindlimb tourniquet-treated rats; III, positive control group; IV, control for cross-circulation influence; preconditioned animals: V, tolerant animals subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO); VI, tolerant animals cross-circulated with SHC, followed by MCAO; VII, SHC animals cross-circulated with tolerant animals and subsequently subjected to MCAO; VIII, tolerant animals cross-circulated with ischemic rats, followed by MCAO; IX, SHC animals cross-circulated with ischemic animals and subjected to MCAO; postconditioned animals: X, ischemic animals treated with a remote limb tourniquet; XI, ischemic animals cross-circulated with SHC control rats; and XII, ischemic animals cross-circulated with tolerant rats. Results confirmed that remote ischemia induced reduction of infarct volume in the preconditioned (V, 60%) as well as in the postconditioned group (X, 52%). Significant diminution was also observed in group XII (56.6%). In the preconditioned group, decreased infarct volume was detected in groups VI and VII (about 65%) and in group IX (about 50%). The greatest infarct reduction (84%) was induced by the presence of ischemic blood in a tolerant rat before ischemia induction. In summary, the factor inducing tolerance to ischemia is generated by remote ischemia and by ischemia itself; from the site of origin to the rest of the body, it is transported by the systemic blood circulation and can be transferred from animal to animal. The effect of conditioning with two different ischemic events (brain and hindlimb ischemia) led to a cumulative, stronger tolerance response.

After a 24 h baseline recording, limb ischemia was induced by tightening an elastic band around the left quadriceps for 10 minutes followed by 10 minutes of release for two cycles. Two days following remote preconditioning, a second 24 h EEG/EMG recording was completed and was immediately followed by a 60-minute suture occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (modeled ischemic stroke).

Brain infarction was determined by vital dye staining, and sleep was assessed by trained identification of EEG/EMG recordings.Results: Two days after limb ischemia, wild-type mice slept an additional 2.4 h. This additional sleep was primarily comprised of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep during the middle of the light-phase (i.e., naps).

N Redington",Stroke,Stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Remote ischemic preconditioning is a phenomenon by which a short period of sublethal ischemia to an organ protects against subsequent ischemia in another organ. We have recently demonstrated that remote ischemic conditioning by transient hind limb ischemia delivered during ischemia and before reperfusion can provide potent cardioprotection, a phenomenon we termed per-conditioning. This study evaluated whether remote ischemic per-conditioning may provide neuroprotection in a clinically relevant rat model of acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: Remote ischemic conditioning by transient limb ischemia was used in a rat transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model of acute stroke. A total of 39 P60 rats were randomly allocated to receive preconditioning, per-conditioning, or sham conditioning. Cerebral ischemia was maintained for 120 minutes followed by reperfusion. The resulting infarct size at 24 hours was quantified using computerized image analysis of 2-3-5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride-stained brain sections. RESULTS: Compared with control, both pre- and per-conditioning significantly reduced brain infarct size with the more clinically relevant per-conditioning stimulus being superior to preconditioning. CONCLUSIONS: Remote per-conditioning by transient limb ischemia is a facile, clinically relevant stimulus that provides potent neuroprotection in a model of regional brain ischemia-reperfusion injury. Further studies are required to better understand the mechanisms and biology of this response before translation to randomized controlled trials of remote per-conditioning for acute ischemic stroke.",http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med7&AN=21836089,,2011,,Journal Article,,,,2024-08-16 14:07:02,825ebfc6-7a60-4df4-86a2-98f0c26f4ecb,SR-SAVI_RIC,False,1b96b68f-9627-4436-b421-db699510f2ae,sofija vojvodic,bf87d29c-6d3d-4e71-a61f-9492b54d77cd,infarct volume,1f7ca780-73be-4315-984b-8d0225765b52,unclear,,2024-09-06 12:47:34,0b791463-e008-4bd6-b732-2a411491a17f,unclear,,2024-09-06 12:47:34,6575a28d-b1b0-4b1d-8fd5-ce5466891987,unclear,,2024-09-06 12:47:34

N Redington",Stroke,Stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Remote ischemic preconditioning is a phenomenon by which a short period of sublethal ischemia to an organ protects against subsequent ischemia in another organ. We have recently demonstrated that remote ischemic conditioning by transient hind limb ischemia delivered during ischemia and before reperfusion can provide potent cardioprotection, a phenomenon we termed per-conditioning. This study evaluated whether remote ischemic per-conditioning may provide neuroprotection in a clinically relevant rat model of acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: Remote ischemic conditioning by transient limb ischemia was used in a rat transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model of acute stroke. A total of 39 P60 rats were randomly allocated to receive preconditioning, per-conditioning, or sham conditioning. Cerebral ischemia was maintained for 120 minutes followed by reperfusion. The resulting infarct size at 24 hours was quantified using computerized image analysis of 2-3-5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride-stained brain sections.

K. Steinberg, H Zhao",Neuroscience,Neuroscience,"Remote ischemic preconditioning is an emerging concept for stroke treatment, but its protection against focal stroke has not been established. We tested whether remote preconditioning, performed in the ipsilateral hind limb, protects against focal stroke and explored its protective parameters. Stroke was generated by a permanent occlusion of the left distal middle cerebral artery (MCA) combined with a 30 min occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries (CCA) in male rats. Limb preconditioning was generated by 5 or 15 min occlusion followed with the same period of reperfusion of the left hind femoral artery, and repeated for two or three cycles. Infarct was measured 2 days later. The results showed that rapid preconditioning with three cycles of 15 min performed immediately before stroke reduced infarct size from 47.7+/-7.6% of control ischemia to 9.8+/-8.6%; at two cycles of 15 min, infarct was reduced to 24.7+/-7.3%; at two cycles of 5 min, infarct was not reduced. Delayed preconditioning with three cycles of 15 min conducted 2 days before stroke also reduced infarct to 23.0+/-10.9%, but with two cycles of 15 min it offered no protection. The protective effects at these two therapeutic time windows of remote preconditioning are consistent with those of conventional preconditioning, in which the preconditioning ischemia is induced in the brain itself. Unexpectedly, intermediate preconditioning with three cycles of 15 min performed 12 h before stroke also reduced infarct to 24.7+/-4.7%, which contradicts the current dogma for therapeutic time windows for the conventional preconditioning that has no protection at this time point.

Hu,Journal of Neuroinflammation,Journal of Neuroinflammation,"Background: Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) of a limb has been reported to protect against ischemic stroke. Our previous results demonstrated that the RIPC-mediated neuroprotection is associated with alterations in circulating immune cell populations. Here, we evaluated the effect of the spleen, the largest reservoir of immune cells, on RIPC-mediated neuroprotection against stroke.Methods: Noninvasive RIPC was achieved by four repeated cycles of 5-min blood flow constriction in the hindlimbs using a tourniquet. The blood and spleens were collected before and 1 h and 3 days after preconditioning to analyze the effect of RIPC on the spleen and the correlation between splenic and peripheral lymphocytes. Moreover, spleen weight and splenic lymphocytes were compared in stroke rats with or without RIPC. Finally, splenectomy was made 1 day or 2 weeks before RIPC and 90-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The infarct areas and deficits were assessed. Blood was collected 1 h after RIPC and 3 days after MCAO to explore the impact of splenectomy on RIPCinduced neuroprotection and immune changes. The contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres were collected 3 days after MCAO to detect the infiltration of immune cells after RIPC and splenectomy.Results: Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that the RIPC promptly increased the percentages of CD3(+)CD8(+) cytotoxic T (Tc) cells in the spleen with a relatively delayed elevation in CD3(+)CD161(+) natural killer T (NKT) and CD3-CD45RA(+) B lymphocytes. The percentages of circulating lymphocytes are positively correlated with the percentages of splenic lymphocytes in normal rats. Interestingly, RIPC resulted in negative correlations between the percentages of splenic and circulating T lymphocytes, while the correlation between splenic and circulating B lymphocytes remained positive. For animals subjected to RIPC followed by MCAO, RIPC increased splenic volume with an expansion of splenic lymphocytes 3 days after MCAO. Furthermore, the removal of the spleen 1 day or 2 weeks before RIPC and MCAO reduced the protective effect of RIPC on ischemic brain injury and reversed the effects of RIPC on circulating immune cell composition. RIPC significantly reduced brain infiltration of Tc and NKT cells.

Prior splenectomy showed no effect on immune cell infiltration after RIPC and stroke.Conclusion: These results reveal an immunomodulatory effect of the spleen, effecting mainly the spleen-derived lymphocytes, during RIPC-afforded neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000433983100002,"Capital Med Univ, Beijing Luhe Hosp, China Amer Inst Neurosci, Beijing 101100, Peoples R ChinaCapital Med Univ, Sch Basic Med Sci, Dept Pathol & Pathophysiol, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaCapital Med Univ, Xuanwu Hosp, Inst Hypoxia Med, Beijing, Peoples R China",2018,"ARTN 16710.1186/s12974-018-1190-9",Journal Article,cerebral ischemia;spleen;lymphocytes;limb remote ischemic preconditioning;focal cerebral-ischemia;limit cns inflammation;brain-damage;immune-response;spleen size;cells;contributes;recovery;activation;prevention,/2107900263/Chen-2018-Splenic responses play an important.pdf,,2024-08-16 14:07:02,825ebfc6-7a60-4df4-86a2-98f0c26f4ecb,SR-SAVI_RIC,False,e599294d-3218-4f40-b4b9-3389481cdde2,Torsten Rackoll,1098a013-4c8a-4adc-bd77-88b8a2197294,Infarct volume,3f796d04-7c7c-495a-8c6e-44a4af7d5faa,unclear,,2024-09-24 10:49:18,93d7cf3a-c9ae-43d3-9150-22a65a5cf169,unclear,,2024-09-24 10:49:18,5a783db8-bc7e-4f65-ac56-f3bde567ad65,low,,2024-09-24 10:49:18

After a 24 h reperfusion, behavioural testing, vascular function, NO concentration and superoxide dismutase activity in the serum were determined. In addition, the infarct size of the brain was also detected. The mRNA of eNOS, nNOS, GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH), P22(phox) and xanthine oxidase (XO) in the ischemic region were detected by RT-PCR, and nitrotyrosine (Tyr-NO2) was detected using Western blot analysis. The results showed that LRIP, FA and FA+LRIP all could improve behavioural score, and increase NO mediated endothelium-dependent vasomotor responses, reduce infarction of rats subjected to IRI. Western blot and RT-PCR analyses showed that the Tyr-NO2 levels and the mRNA expression of NADPH oxidase catalytic subunit P22(phox) and XO were up-regulated in the ischemic brain, which was significantly inhibited by LRIP, FA and FA+LRIP.

This study clarified the mechanism of LRIP based on the nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)-P38 pathway of neutrophils. Rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was used in this study. Ischemia-reperfusion injury was carried out by MCAO 1.5 h followed by 24 h reperfusion. LRIP operation was performed to the left femoral artery at 0, 1 or 3 h after reperfusion. Behavioral testing, including postural reflex test, vibrissae-elicited forelimb placing test and tail hang test, showed that LRIP operated at 0 h of reperfusion could significantly ameliorate these behavioral scores. Pathological examinations, infarct size, Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity showed that LRIP operated at 0 h of reperfusion could significantly ameliorate the pathological scores, reduce the infarct size and MPO activity in the brain and increase the MPO activity in the left leg. By using Neutrophil counting, immunofluorescence and real-time PCR techniques, we found that LRIP operated at 0 h of reperfusion could reduce neutrophil counts in the peripheral blood and downregulate the activation of neutrophil in the peripheral blood and rat brain.

This study was performed to examine the effect of RIPostC on cerebral I/R and to explore its underlying mechanism.Methods: Healthy male SD rats (N = 36) were assigned randomly into 3 groups of 12 each: sham group, I/R model group and RIPostC group. Animal models were performed by filament insertion for 2 h with middle cerebral artery occlusion(MCAO) followed by 24 h of reperfusion.

The present study was designed to investigate the potential regulation of limb remote ischemic post-conditioning (RIPC) on astrocytic plasticity in experimental cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Cerebral ischemia was induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) for 1 h in C57BL/6 mice, who were treated with RIPC immediately after reperfusion. The results showed that RIPC decreased hemispheric swelling, infarct volume and brain atrophy, and increased neurological function recovery and survival rates of ischemic mice at 3 and 14 d after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, respectively. Moreover, the proportion of astrocyte subtypes was adjusted by RIPC treatment, demonstrated by decreased expression of the fibrous type (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP) and increased expression of the protoplasmic type (glutamine synthetase, GS) in the ipsilateral side of the mouse brain at 14 d after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. RIPC treatment adjusted the proportion of GFAP subtypes by downregulating the protein level of GFAP alpha, as well as upregulating the GFAP delta/GFAP alpha ratio in the ipsilateral side at 3 and 14 d after reperfusion. Notably, RIPC inhibited the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activators of transcriptions 3 (p-STAT3) in the ipsilateral side at 3 and 14 d after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.

L. Chai, D. L. Zeng, Q Wu",Chinese Pharmacological Bulletin,Chinese Pharmacological Bulletin,"Aim: To study the protective effects of limb remote ischemic postconditioning (LRIP) on ischemic stroke rats under hyperglycemia and explore the mechanisms. Methods: Rats were given 50% glucose (6 mL . kg<sup>-1</sup>) by intraperitoneal injection to get acute hyperglycemia model. Then middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) models were created.

Qi,Mol Med Rep,Mol Med Rep,"Ischemic postconditioning has been demonstrated to alleviate brain ischemia/reperfusion-induced neuronal apoptosis; however, the protective mechanisms underlying the improved and more convenient method of remote ischemic postconditioning (RIPostC) are only recently beginning to be elucidated. Mitochondria are important in the regulation of cell apoptosis, and the B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2) homology 3 interacting‑domain death agonist (BID) promotes the insertion/oligomerization of Bcl‑2‑associated X protein into the mitochondrial outer membrane, leading to the release of proapoptotic proteins from the mitochondria. The present study hypothesized that RIPostC targets the BID‑mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway to exert neuroprotective effects, and the optimal time window for RIPostC application was investigated. RIPostC was conducted as follows: Three 10‑min cycles of bilateral femoral artery occlusion with intervals of 10 min reperfusion after 0, 10 or 30 min of brain reperfusion. The results revealed that reperfusion induced significant activation of BID, via proteolytic cleavage and translocation to the mitochondria, as determined using western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining. Mitochondrial release of cytochrome c was additionally detected during BID activation, all of which were inhibited by the application of RIPostC. When RIPostC was applied during reperfusion, it demonstrated a significant protective effect. Furthermore, the infarct volume, neurological function and the degree of neuronal apoptosis were improved with application of RIPostC.

Ergul;S. K. Zaidi;S. C. Fagan;D. C. Hess,Translational Stroke Research,Translational Stroke Research,"Remote ischemic conditioning is neuroprotective in young male rodents after experimental stroke. However, it has never been tested in females whom remain at higher risk of stroke injury after menopause. We tested remote ischemic perconditioning therapy (RIPerC) at 2 h after embolic stroke in ovariectomized (OVX) female mice with and without intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV-tPA) treatment. We assessed cerebral blood flow (CBF), neurobehavioral outcomes, infarction, hemorrhage, edema, and survival. RIPerC therapy with and without IV-tPA improved the CBF and neurobehavioral outcomes and reduced the infarction, hemorrhage, and edema significantly.

We assessed cerebral blood flow up to 6 hours, neurological deficits, injury size, and phosphorylation of Akt (Serine(473)) as a prosurvival signal in the ischemic hemisphere at 48 hours poststroke.Results-RIPerC therapy alone improved the cerebral blood flow and neurological outcomes. tPA alone at 4 hours did not significantly improve the neurological outcome even after successful thrombolysis.

METHODS: One hundred twenty-eight Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned into eight groups (n=16 each): MCAO, Control, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropulxanthine (DPCPX, Adenosine A1 receptor antagonist), RIPC, DPCPX+RIPC, Vehicle+RIPC, 2-chloro-N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine (CCPA, Adenosine A1 receptor agonist) and CCPA+DPCPX groups. All animals underwent right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2 h. Limb RIPC consisted of three cycles of 5-minute ischemia followed by 5-minute reperfusion in right hind-limb by tourniquet application. Neurological deficit scores were evaluated 24 h after reperfusion, and then the infarct volume was assessed with diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Inflammation was assessed by serum tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF(alpha)) and NO; oxidative stress was estimated by malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxyalkenals (4-HAD), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and GSH. RESULTS: Animals in the RIPC, Vehicle+RIPC and CCPA groups developed lower neurological deficit scores and smaller brain infarct volumes than the Control group (P<0.01). Animals in the DPCPX, DPCPX+RIPC and CCPA+DPCPX groups developed higher neurological deficit scores and larger brain infarct volumes than the RIPC, Vehicle+RIPC and CCPA groups (P<0.01). DPCPX abolished the protective effects of RIPC and CCPA. RIPC or CCPA induced a significant increase in brain MnSOD (manganese SOD) activity and NO generation, and this activity was abolished by DPCPX pretreatment. RIPC or CCPA induced a significant reduction (P<0.05) in the GSH and MDA+4HDA concentration and an accumulation in the GSSG concentration in both compartments (serum and tissue) as compared with the MCAO group. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that limb RIPC induced by noninvasive tourniquet reduces cerebral ischemic injury in rats, and the effect of neuroprotection may depend on the activation of adenosine A1 receptors.

Jiang,PERFUSION-UK,PERFUSION-UK,"Objective: Using a rodent model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), we investigated the effect of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) on spatial learning and memory ability after focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R).Method: Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated into 3 groups (n=12, each): sham group, rats were subjected to sham operations without MCAO and RIPC; I/R group, rats were subjected to 1h of MCAO followed by 3 days of reperfusion; I/R+RIPC group, rats were subjected to RIPC and 1h MCAO followed by 3 days of reperfusion. The spatial learning and memory ability of the rats was measured by the Morris water maze task. The activity of cholineacetyltransferase (ChAT) in the hippocampus CA1 region was observed by an immunohistochemistry method.Results: In the Morris water maze task, MCAO elicited a significant decrease of the ability of spatial learning and memory in contrast to the sham group.

Jiang,PERFUSION-UK,PERFUSION-UK,"Objective: Using a rodent model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), we investigated the effect of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) on spatial learning and memory ability after focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R).Method: Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated into 3 groups (n=12, each): sham group, rats were subjected to sham operations without MCAO and RIPC; I/R group, rats were subjected to 1h of MCAO followed by 3 days of reperfusion; I/R+RIPC group, rats were subjected to RIPC and 1h MCAO followed by 3 days of reperfusion. The spatial learning and memory ability of the rats was measured by the Morris water maze task. The activity of cholineacetyltransferase (ChAT) in the hippocampus CA1 region was observed by an immunohistochemistry method.Results: In the Morris water maze task, MCAO elicited a significant decrease of the ability of spatial learning and memory in contrast to the sham group.

METHODS: Rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: sham group (n=10), ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) group (n=50), and NLIP group (n=50). Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by intraluminal MCAO in the rats in the I/R and NLIP groups, while no suture was inserted in the sham-operated rats. NLIP (reperfusion-10 min, ischemia-10 min, x3 cycles) was conducted immediately after reperfusion on bilateral femoral arteries by modified ischemicelastic bands.

METHODS: Rats were randomly divided into 6 groups that were ischemia/reperfusion group, unilateral hindlimb ischemia group (uLIPC), bilateral hindlimbs ischemia group (bLIPC), bLIPC + antagonist of kappa-opioid receptor nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI) group, bLIPC + mito K(ATP) blocker 5-hydroxydecanoate(5-HD) group, bLIPC + extracorporeal circulation of bilateral hindlimbs via femoral arteries (EC) group. Cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), neurological scores, plasma levels of dynorphin and enkephalin, the brain infarct areas were determined after reperfusion. RESULTS: Unilateral LIPC partially improved the neurological score after local brain ischemia and reperfusion injury in rat (P < 0.05), and decreased the infarct area compared with the untreated group undergoing brain ischemia and reperfusion (P < 0.01). Bilateral LIPC significantly improved the neurological score after local brain ischemia and reperfusion injury (P < 0.01), and decreased the infarct area (P < 0.01). The neurological scores of bilateral LIPC group were significant higher than those of unilateral LIPC (P < 0.05). The plasma level of dynorphin was significantly increased (P < 0.01) at 5, 15, 30 min, 1 and 2 h after bilateral LIPC, however, it deceased to the normal level at 12 h after bilateral LIPC. The plasma level of enkephalin showed no obvious change after bilateral LIPC (P > 0.05). nor-BNI (25 nmol/L) and 5-HD (10 mg/kg) abolished the effect of bilateral LIPC (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: LIPC protects rat from local brain ischemia and reperfusion injury. Mito K(ATP) may be involved in the neuroprotection, and kappa-opioid receptor may also participate in the protective effect.",http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med6&AN=21155238,,2009,,Journal Article,,,,2024-08-16 14:07:02,825ebfc6-7a60-4df4-86a2-98f0c26f4ecb,SR-SAVI_RIC,False,e599294d-3218-4f40-b4b9-3389481cdde2,Torsten Rackoll,ccdbe99e-33f9-49f7-ba3c-6f3a43a05f0f,Infarct volume,00813d03-3f62-40c4-83b8-8b417a35008d,unclear,,2024-09-24 11:36:36,6f67b427-79c2-4fef-a647-39d9ab508536,unclear,,2024-09-24 11:36:36,9e761341-9d84-4336-902b-e494ed2a2162,unclear,,2024-09-24 11:36:36

Ren,Journal of the Neurological Sciences,Journal of the Neurological Sciences,"Remote limb preconditioning (RPC) ameliorates ischemia-induced cerebral infarction and promotes neurological function recovery; however, the mechanism of RPC hasn't been fully understood, which limits its clinical application. The present study aimed at exploring the underlying mechanism of RPC through testing its effects on neuronal oxidative DNA damage and parthanatos in a rat focal cerebral ischemia model. Infarct volume was investigated by 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, and neuronal survival was evaluated by Nissl staining. Oxidative DNA damage was investigated via analyzing the expression of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). Besides, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and DNA laddering were utilized to evaluate neuronal DNA fragmentation. Moreover, we tested whether RPC regulated poly(ADP-ribose) polymer (PAR) and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) pathway; thus, PAR expression, AIF translocation and AIF/histone H2AX (H2AX) interaction were investigated. The results showed that RPC exerted neuroprotective effects by ameliorating oxidative DNA damage and neuronal parthanatos; additionally, RPC suppressed PAR/AIF pathway through reducing AIF translocation and AIF/H2AX interaction.

Wu;K. Liu;Y. Zhang;G. Ma;L. Wang,J Neurol Sci,J Neurol Sci,"It has been reported that remote ischemic postconditioning was able to protect from a harmful ischemia occurring in brain. In the present study, we investigated the role of p38 MAPK signal pathway in the process of neuroprotection and anti-apoptosis following remote limb ischemic postconditioning on rat focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into four groups: the sham-operated group, I/R group, limb ischemic postconditioning (LPostC) group, and LPostC+SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) group. Focal ischemia was induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Limb ischemic postconditioning was implemented by brief cycles of femoral artery occlusion. At 24h after modeling, we analyzed the neurological deficit score, assessed the cerebral tissue morphology by H-E staining, and evaluated neuronal apoptosis by TUNEL staining. The protein expression levels of p-p38 or p-ATF2 (phospho-activating transcription factor 2) in the penumbra region were detected by western blotting or immunohistochemical staining. Our findings revealed that LPostC relieved cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by decreasing neurological score, improving neuronal morphological changes in the ischemic penumbra area, and reducing neuronal apoptosis. In addition, LPostC or LPostC+SB203580 attenuated the increase in p-p38 and p-ATF2 levels in ischemia/reperfusion brain tissue. These results indicate that the protective effects of LPostC against cerebral I/R injury may be related to the attenuation of neuronal apoptosis and the suppression of p38 MAPK-ATF2 pathway.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26282496,"Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China; Department of Neurology, Guangdong Neuroscience Institute, Guangdong General Hospital and Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.Department of Endocrinology, Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University, Guilin, China.Department of Neurology, Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University, Guilin, China.Department of Neurology, Guangdong Neuroscience Institute, Guangdong General Hospital and Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.Department of Neurology, Guangdong Neuroscience Institute, Guangdong General Hospital and Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.

Taken together, these findings demonstrated that RIPostC protected the brain from I/R injury after focal cerebral ischemia by reducing oxidative stress and activating the Nrf2-ARE (antioxidant response element) pathway.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26000916,"a Department of Neurology , Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University , Baoding , Hebei , PR China.b Department of Neurology , Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University , Shijiazhuang , Hebei , PR China.c Hebei Collaborative Innovation Center for Cardio-cerebrovascular Disease , Shijiazhuang , Hebei , PR China.d Hebei Key Laboratory for Neurology , Shijiazhuang , Hebei , PR China.",2016,10.3109/00207454.2015.1042973,Journal Article,antioxidative stress;cerebral ischemia;ischemia/reperfusion injury;neuroprotection;remote ischemic postconditioning,/2952558930/Li-2016-Remote limb ischemic postconditioning.pdf,,2024-08-16 14:07:02,825ebfc6-7a60-4df4-86a2-98f0c26f4ecb,SR-SAVI_RIC,False,1b96b68f-9627-4436-b421-db699510f2ae,sofija vojvodic,48c1c897-99c4-4a39-ba97-4c95534e58c6,infarct volume,29e425c4-c52c-4617-b41d-bf930be62b19,unclear,,2024-09-19 13:53:18,4c02c3a8-4b16-4c7c-a089-4b34c6812e6e,unclear,,2024-09-19 13:53:18,9eb2c7c3-a63f-49f9-aeec-04fb6c393993,low,,2024-09-19 13:53:18

Previous studies have suggested that remote ischemic post-conditioning (RIPC) is a potential useful tool for cerebral ischemic treatment. However, the protective mechanism of RIPC is not very clear. This study verified the hypothesis that, in remote post-conditioning of cerebral ischemic rats, down-regulation of aquaporin 4 (AQP4), which is an important player for water hemostasis in astrocytes, could attenuate cerebral damage after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). In this study, RIPC model was established after MCAO. Each hind limb of rat was clamped by small rubber tubes for 10 min, and then the tubes were opened for 10 min. The clamping and opening were operated for a total of three cycles to block the hind limbs blood flow. The results showed that, RIPC could significantly improve neurological function, decrease the percentage of the infarct volume and edema, and elevate the integrity of blood-brain barrier (BBB). In addition, the numbers of AQP4 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive cells were significantly lower in the RIPC group. Moreover, we found that AQP4 expression decreased in response to ischemia/reperfusion in the RIPC group.

Notably, while control rats exhibited an initial dilation followed by a progressive narrowing of pial arterioles 60 to 150-min post-MCAo (constricting to 80-90% of post-MCAo peak diameter), this constriction was prevented or reversed by RIPerC (such that vessel diameters increased to 105-110% of post-MCAo, pre-RIPerC diameter). RIPerC significantly reduced early ischemic damage measured 6 h after stroke onset. Thus, prevention of collateral collapse via RIPerC is neuroprotective and may facilitate other protective or recanalization therapies by improving blood flow in penumbral tissue.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000406514300029,"Univ Alberta, Neurosci & Mental Hlth Inst, Edmonton, AB, CanadaUniv Alberta, Dept Psychiat, Neurochem Res Unit, Edmonton, AB, CanadaShantou Univ, Coll Med, Affiliated Hosp 1, Shantou, Peoples R ChinaUniv Alberta, Div Neurol, Dept Med, Edmonton, AB, Canada",2017,10.1177/0271678x16680636,Journal Article,collateral circulation;ischemia;laser speckle contrast imaging;neuroprotection;two-photon microscopy;focal cerebral-ischemia;transient aortic occlusion;laser speckle flowmetry;blood-flow;embolic stroke;physiopharmacological investigations;plasminogen-activator;urethane anesthesia;artery occlusion;randomized-trial,/3978566838/Ma-2017-Prevention of the collapse of pial col.pdf,,2024-08-16 14:07:02,825ebfc6-7a60-4df4-86a2-98f0c26f4ecb,SR-SAVI_RIC,False,96b6bdc6-13fd-4440-84f4-1342ebd6b178,María Arroyo Araujo,2937a348-d457-4be7-b93f-4dc0991c15e0,Infarct volume,c020b7a1-8845-4df7-9b53-261256285e07,unclear,,2024-09-23 08:54:54,e56bb686-7a07-4df4-b2f5-dfdd5ab07205,low,"""Distal MCA ligation and imaging

Zhao,Brain Research,Brain Research,"Remote ischemic postconditioning (RIP) refers to an ischemia conducted in a distant organ that protects against a prior ischemia in another organ. We tested whether RIP protects against focal ischemia in the rat brain. Stroke was generated by a permanent occlusion of the left distal middle cerebral artery combined with a 30-min occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries (CCA) in male rats. After CCA release, RIP was generated by three cycles of 15-min occlusion/15-min release of the left-hind femoral artery. The results showed that rapid RIP performed immediately after CCA release reduced infarction by 67% measured at 2 days after stroke. In addition, delayed RIP initiated as late as 3 h, but not 6 h, still robustly reduced infarction by 43% 2 days after stroke. RIP's protective effect was abolished by injecting the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, and the afferent nerve blocker, capsaicin, suggesting that RIP blocks ischemic injury by modulating protein synthesis and nerve activity.

Zhao,Brain Research,Brain Research,"Remote ischemic postconditioning (RIP) refers to an ischemia conducted in a distant organ that protects against a prior ischemia in another organ. We tested whether RIP protects against focal ischemia in the rat brain. Stroke was generated by a permanent occlusion of the left distal middle cerebral artery combined with a 30-min occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries (CCA) in male rats. After CCA release, RIP was generated by three cycles of 15-min occlusion/15-min release of the left-hind femoral artery. The results showed that rapid RIP performed immediately after CCA release reduced infarction by 67% measured at 2 days after stroke. In addition, delayed RIP initiated as late as 3 h, but not 6 h, still robustly reduced infarction by 43% 2 days after stroke. RIP's protective effect was abolished by injecting the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, and the afferent nerve blocker, capsaicin, suggesting that RIP blocks ischemic injury by modulating protein synthesis and nerve activity. Nevertheless, rapid RIP did not reduce infarction size 2 months after stroke while it ameliorated the outcome of the behavioral test. In conclusion, RIP attenuates brain injury after focal ischemia.

We conclude that RIPC, chloral hydrate, and Zoletil produce a significant neuroprotective effect, but the simultaneous use of anesthetics with RIPC does not enhance the degree of neuroprotection.",<Go to ISI>://WOS:000410704200003,"Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Belozersky Inst Physicochem Biol, Moscow 119992, RussiaLomonosov Moscow State Univ, Int Laser Ctr, Moscow 119992, RussiaLomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Bioengn & Bioinformat, Moscow 119992, RussiaLomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Fundamental Med, Moscow 119992, RussiaLomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Phys, Moscow 119992, Russia",2017,10.1134/S0006297917090036,Journal Article,ischemia;brain;remote preconditioning;hind limb;chloral hydrate;zoletil;focal cerebral-ischemia;nmda receptor antagonists;reduces infarct size;hippocampal-neurons;chloral hydrate;rats;tolerance;injury;brain;mitochondrial,/2528096472/Silachev-2017-Effect of anesthetics on efficie.pdf,,2024-08-16 14:07:02,825ebfc6-7a60-4df4-86a2-98f0c26f4ecb,SR-SAVI_RIC,False,96b6bdc6-13fd-4440-84f4-1342ebd6b178,María Arroyo Araujo,7a3f59fb-4b85-4aaf-9fca-dd95988e7dc5,Infarct volume,1e638fab-e75d-414f-8fc2-dae40b9ca9f5,unclear,,2024-09-22 18:29:16,767853d7-af88-497b-abcf-e9463c7ab5f6,unclear,,2024-09-22 18:29:16,643b770e-8d12-4a91-9249-6801896c5d99,unclear,,2024-09-22 18:29:16

We attempted to investigate the implications of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and delta protein kinase C (delta PKC) in neuroprotection induced by RPostC in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia, and also to explore a possible relationship between ROS and epsilon PKC.METHODS: Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion using the intraluminal filament technique in male rats. RPostC was generated by 3 10-minute cycles of femoral artery occlusion/reperfusion on the right limb at the onset of middle cerebral artery reperfusion. RPostC was performed alone or with pretreatment of N-acetylcysteine, a ROS scavenger. In separate group, TAT-delta V1-1, a delta PKC-selective peptide inhibitor, was administered at the onset of reperfusion. Brain ischemic injury was evaluated by neurologic scores, infarction volumes, and TUNEL staining. Moreover, the activation of delta PKC in the ischemic penumbra was investigated by Western blot after reperfusion.RESULTS: RPostC improved neurologic outcome, reduced infarct size, and inhibited neuronal apoptosis as well as suppressed the activation of delta PKC after reperfusion. Moreover, systemic delivery of TAT-delta V1-1 conferred neuroprotection against cerebral reperfusion injury at the onset of reperfusion. Pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine not only completely prevented all aspects of RPostC-induced neuroprotection, but also reversed RPostC-induced inhibition of delta PKC activation after reperfusion.CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that RPostC performed in one limb alleviated reperfusion injury after focal cerebral ischemia through ROS-mediated inhibition of endogenous delta PKC activation signaling cascade in an in vivo rat model of focal cerebral ischemia.

Pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine not only completely prevented all aspects of RPostC-induced neuroprotection, but also reversed RPostC-induced inhibition of delta PKC activation after reperfusion.CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that RPostC performed in one limb alleviated reperfusion injury after focal cerebral ischemia through ROS-mediated inhibition of endogenous delta PKC activation signaling cascade in an in vivo rat model of focal cerebral ischemia.

Therefore, potential protective effects of limb ischemic preconditioning (LIP) on subsequent ischemic injury of the brain were investigated by evaluating anti-inflammatory effects and apoptosis of pyramidal neurons in the CAI hippocampus. One hundred and eight Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group (n=54) and the LIP group (n=54). A thread was used to occlude the middle cerebral artery in the MCAO group and the LIP group animals were pretreated with LIP followed by MCAO.

Neurological severity scores (NSS) were examined before the animals were sacrificed. Compared with the LIP group, cerebral histopathological changes in the MCAO group were most distinct and significantly more infiltrated inflammatory and apoptotic neuronal cells were observed at 24, 48 and 72 h post-surgery.

Wang;H. X. Li,Turkish Journal of Medical Sciences,Turkish Journal of Medical Sciences,"Aim: To determine the effect of limb remote ischemic postconditioning (LIPoC) against cerebral ischemia reperfusion in rats and the relationship between cycle number or remote postconditioning episode duration and the protective function of LIPoC.Materials and methods: Transient focal ischemia/reperfusion was induced by 90 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with nylon monofilament and 22 h of reperfusion in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The animals underwent LIPoC consisting of 1, 2, or 3 cycles, with each occlusion or release lasting for 5 min (5/5), 10 min (10/10), or 15 min (15/15) of bilateral femoral artery occlusion/release.

Y. Lu Y. Li",Journal of Clinical Neurology,Journal of Clinical Neurology,"Objective: To investigate effects of limbs ischemic postconditioning induced remote postconditioning (RPostC) on mitochondria structure and function after focal cerebral ischemic reperfusion (I/R) injury in diabetic rats. Methods: The diabetic rats models were induced by injecting streptozotocin into abdominal cavity. I/R rats models were made by MCAO with thread. Forty male SD rats models were assigned to 4 groups: control group; sham operation group; I/R group; RPostC group (n = 10). 6 h after the reperfusion, the brains were obtained for HE staining. The mitchondria were isolated and content of MDA, the activities of SOD, Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase and GSH-Px were tested. Morphological changes of neuronal mitochondria were observed by electronic microscope. Results: In the I/R group, the content of mitchondria MDA[(4.99 +/- 1.25) nmol/mgprot] were markedly increased (P < 0. 01) and the activities of mitochondria SOD [(72. 52 +/- 13. 07) U/mg], Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase [(3.17 +/- 0.34) mumolPi/(mg . h)], Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase[(1.56 +/- 0.23) mumolPi/(mg . h)] and GSH-Px[(22.66 +/- 5.29) U/mg)] were decreased significantly (all P < 0.01). Compared with the I/R group, the content of mitchondria MDA (3.58 +/- 0.91 nmol/mg) of the RPostC group were markedly decreased and the activities of mitochondria SOD [99.57 +/- 17.80 U/mg)], Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase[(5.89 +/- 0.53) mumolPi/(mg . h)], Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase [(3.16 +/- 0.31) mumolPi/(mg . h)] and GSH-Px[(31.72 +/- 6.14) U/mg)] were enhanced (P < 0.05 ~ 0.01). RPostC reduced the brain and mitochondria pathological damage induced by cerebral I/R. Conclusions: RPostC can be induced by transient limbs ischemia and have an obvious protective effect on brain and mitochondria damage in diabetic rats. The mechanism of protection may be related to increase of the activities of SOD, Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> -ATPase, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase and GSH-Px.",http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed11&AN=354513898,,2009,,Journal Article,,,,2024-08-16 14:07:02,825ebfc6-7a60-4df4-86a2-98f0c26f4ecb,SR-SAVI_RIC,False,1b96b68f-9627-4436-b421-db699510f2ae,sofija vojvodic,3f0ef9dd-26fb-4e2a-a4c8-3006570faf8a,infarct volume,f22ab0ab-86d4-4489-944e-f87ff725b894,unclear,,2024-09-12 15:18:10,a5ab841e-fb53-4469-9f4e-3d01731afceb,unclear,,2024-09-12 15:18:10,19e38972-8c3b-4b55-ba28-1379449d6db2,unclear,,2024-09-12 15:18:10

L. Zhao;Y. Xue;Z. H. Liu;S. Ren;X. C. Guan;M. Li;X. Zhao;Y. Song;X. P. Ren,NeuroReport,NeuroReport,"Remote ischemia preconditioning (RIPC) is a convenient and effective method for alleviating cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). However, to date, the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. The aim of this research was to explore the protective mechanism of RIPC on the brain after CIRI. Four groups of rats were included in this experiment: the sham group, the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group, the RIPC group, and the AG490 group. As an inhibitor of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), AG490 was used after MCAO in the AG490 group to explore the role of JAK2/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) after CIRI. Brain tissue was collected for evaluation after 2 h of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion. ELISA for interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, western blot for phosphorylated-JAK2 and phosphorylated-STAT3, the neurological severity score and Longa scoring system for neurological deficit evaluation, triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining for cerebral infarction, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling staining for apoptotic cells in the brain tissue were performed. Neurological function in the RIPC group was notably better than that in the MCAO group. There were smaller infarction sizes and fewer apoptotic cells in the ischemic area in the RIPC group than in the MCAO group. In the RIPC group, the expression levels of IL-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6, and phosphorylated-JAK2 and phosphorylated-STAT3 were significantly lower than those in the MCAO group.

L. Zhao;Y. Xue;Z. H. Liu;S. Ren;X. C. Guan;M. Li;X. Zhao;Y. Song;X. P. Ren,NeuroReport,NeuroReport,"Remote ischemia preconditioning (RIPC) is a convenient and effective method for alleviating cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). However, to date, the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. The aim of this research was to explore the protective mechanism of RIPC on the brain after CIRI. Four groups of rats were included in this experiment: the sham group, the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group, the RIPC group, and the AG490 group. As an inhibitor of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), AG490 was used after MCAO in the AG490 group to explore the role of JAK2/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) after CIRI. Brain tissue was collected for evaluation after 2 h of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion. ELISA for interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, western blot for phosphorylated-JAK2 and phosphorylated-STAT3, the neurological severity score and Longa scoring system for neurological deficit evaluation, triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining for cerebral infarction, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling staining for apoptotic cells in the brain tissue were performed. Neurological function in the RIPC group was notably better than that in the MCAO group. There were smaller infarction sizes and fewer apoptotic cells in the ischemic area in the RIPC group than in the MCAO group. In the RIPC group, the expression levels of IL-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6, and phosphorylated-JAK2 and phosphorylated-STAT3 were significantly lower than those in the MCAO group. The findings in the RIPC and AG490 groups were similar. The inflammatory response and apoptosis are two important processes involved in brain dysfunction after CIRI. The JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway has an underlying relationship with these two processes.

Xue,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,"OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the role of mitophagy controlled by Parkin/DJ-1 in remote ischemic post conditioning-induced mitigation of focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety adult male rats were randomly assigned into 5 groups including a sham operation group (S) and ischemia-reperfusion group (I/R). Focal cerebral I/R was induced by right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). I/R+remote ischemic postconditioning (I/R+RIPoC), I/R+RIPoC+ mitophagy inhibitor Mdivi-1 (I/R+RIPoC+M), and I/R+RIPoC+ normal saline (I/R+RIPoC+NS) groups all received 3 cycles of 10 minutes reperfusion followed by 10 minutes ischemia in bilateral femoral arteries at the beginning of cerebral reperfusion. I/R+RIPoC+M received mitochondrial division inhibitor (Mdivi-1) before ischemia and after 24h of reperfusion, neurological deficit scores (NDSs) were measured and rats were then sacrificed. Brain was removed and size of the infarct was determined. Apoptosis index and LC3-II/I ratio, Parkin/DJ-1 proteins expression, SOD activity, MDA and 15-F2t-Isoprostane content in cerebral ischemic penumbra were studied. Linear correlation between Parkin/DJ-1 proteins expression and LC3-II/I ratio and cerebral infarct size were analyzed. RESULTS: In experimental groups the NDSs, percentage of cerebral infarct size, apoptosis index, LC3-II/I ratio, MDA and 15-F2t-Isoprostane content significantly increased and Parkin/DJ-1 proteins were up-regulated (p<0.05). In I/R+RIPoC and I/R+RIPoC+NS groups, NDSs, percentage of cerebral infarct size, apoptosis index, MDA and 15-F2t-Isoprostane content decreased significantly while LC3-II/I ratio and SOD activity increased compared to I/R group. Parkin/DJ-1 proteins were up-regulated in I/R+RIPoC, I/R+RIPoC+NS and I/R+RIPoC+M groups (p<0.05). LC3-II/I ratio and SOD activity significantly decreased (p<0.05). Parkin/DJ-1 proteins expression didn't changed in I/R+RIPoC+M group (p>0.05). The Parkin/DJ-1 proteins expression were positively correlated with LC3-II/I ratio, and negatively correlated with cerebral infarct size (p<0.05).
